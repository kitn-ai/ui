// Sample data for <kc-reasoning>. One file per element;

// `named`   = alternate sets a focused <Example data="…"> can opt into

// kc-reasoning has no non-scalar props. However `text` is a scalar string that
// needs a realistic multi-sentence value so the playground renders something
// meaningful rather than an empty block. We seed it here following the same
// pattern as kc-code-block.
