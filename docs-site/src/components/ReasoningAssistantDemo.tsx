Start by diffing the Tuesday release for new blocking calls (a DB query, a cache miss path, an N+1) gated behind a condition. Pull a trace for a few of the slow requests and look at what they share.',

That magnitude usually comes from a *new* blocking operation on a conditional path — something that fires for a subset of requests. The deploy is the obvious trigger.\n\nFirst step is to narrow the slice: get traces for the slow requests and find the common attribute.',

Check the span: one call per request at ~700 ms means the pricing service is the bottleneck; many small calls means an N+1 inside the promo loop. If it’s a single slow call, cache the promo→discount lookup (it changes rarely) and set a tight timeout so a slow pricing response degrades to “no discount” instead of stalling checkout.',

The fix differs, so I need the span count before recommending one.\n\nFor either shape, a timeout + fallback protects checkout latency regardless of root cause — worth recommending now.',

That caps the tail near p50 even if pricing has a bad minute.';
