/**
 * The DELIVERY FORMS of a block -- one renderer, shared by every front door.
 *
 * A block is authored once, framework-neutral: a page of `kai-*` elements plus
 * an imperative entry script (spec 2026-08-31, Part 3). This module renders
 * that one source into each form a consumer can receive:
 *
 *   - `html` - the web-component form `create-kai add` writes into any
 *              non-react project: the authored page with its bindings taken
 *              off the markup plus a GENERATED binder (see `./html`), with
 *              registration adapted for a bundler.
 *   - `react`- the react form: the block root as a tree of the typed
 *              wrappers from `@kitn.ai/ui/react`, plus a `useSyncExternalStore`
 *              adapter over the controller (see `./react`).
 *   - `vue`  - the vue form: a `<script setup lang="ts">` SFC over the custom
 *              elements, plus a composable holding one `shallowRef` over the
 *              controller's snapshot (see `./vue`).
 *   - `svelte` - the svelte form: a runes-mode component over the custom
 *              elements, plus a `create<Name>()` store in a `.svelte.ts`
 *              module holding one `$state` over the controller's snapshot
 *              (see `./svelte`).
 *   - `cdn`  : the single-file CDN paste form: the HTML form above, inlined
 *              and pinned onto the published entries by `registry.ts`'s
 *              `generateCdnForm` (see `./cdn`).
 *
 * ONE RENDERER, TWO CALLERS, by the same precedent as `registry.ts`:
 * `create-kai` bundle-imports this module (`src/react-form.ts` re-exports it,
 * `src/blocks.ts` plans writes over it), and `gen-blocks.mjs` renders the
 * identical output per framework into `dist/blocks/f/<name>.<form>.json`,
 * which is what the docs site's /blocks section shows. A drift between "what
 * /blocks shows" and "what add writes" is therefore a build failure, never a
 * runtime surprise.
 *
 * DISCIPLINE -- pure functions over injected data, no `node:*` imports, same
 * as `registry.ts`: this file typechecks under the package's browser tsconfig
 * (the /blocks page imports the form axis directly) and bundles into the CLI.

 * Add a `<name>.js` twin beside every `<name>.ts` file the block ships.
 *
 * WHERE THE STRIP HAPPENS, and why not here: the controller is TypeScript and
 * the html and cdn forms land in contexts with no build step, so the types
 * have to come off. This package cannot strip them (it depends on nothing
 * that can) and neither can the renderer that runs on a consumer's machine:
 * `create-kai add` runs on Node >= 20.19, which predates
 * `module.stripTypeScriptTypes`. And "each caller strips with what it has"
 * makes this module's central claim false, because two strippers emit two
 * different files.
 *
 * So the strip runs ONCE, at generation time, with esbuild, and the twin
 * TRAVELS with the block: packages/ui/scripts/gen-blocks.mjs writes it into
 * the emitted item JSON, and packages/create-kai/scripts/build.mjs writes it
 * beside the copied source. Everything downstream just reads the file.
