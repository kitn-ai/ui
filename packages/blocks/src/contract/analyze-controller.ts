 * The controller's DECLARED shape (spec 3.2), read off the source.
 *
 * WHY NOT A REAL PARSER. `packages/blocks` cannot depend on `typescript`
 * (create-kai bundles this source into its CLI and `bundleGraphProblem`
 * grades that bundle) and cannot depend on `esbuild` for the same reason --
 * and esbuild could not answer this question anyway: it reports RUNTIME
 * exports, and every name here except `createController` is a TYPE, erased
 * before a metafile exists.
 *
 * So this reads only what the CONTRACT FIXES: three interfaces named after
 * the block, and one exported factory. Fixing those names is what makes the
 * react adapter generatable at all, so a wrong name is an error that says
 * which identifier it wanted.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY IS THE POINT. An empty result is a HARD ERROR, never a quiet
 * empty list: the html form has no typecheck behind it, so this is the only
 * thing standing between a typo and `actions.bck is not a function` at
 * runtime. For the react form tsc is the backstop and this is the early,
 * legible failure.

/**
 * Split an interface body into member tokens at `;`, `,` and newline, but
 * ONLY when the separator sits at bracket depth zero.
 *
 * P5: a single-line body (`{ boot(): void; send(text: string): void }`) puts
 * every member after the first on the SAME line as the one before it, so a
 * line-anchored match reads only the first member -- fixed by tokenizing on
 * `;`/`,`/newline. But a naive split on those characters ALSO cuts inside a
 * parameter list: `send(text: string, opts: { silent: boolean }): void`
 * would split at the `,` between parameters and again inside the object
 * type, leaking `opts` as if it were its own member. So depth is tracked
 * across `(`, `{`, `[` and `<` and a separator only ends a token at depth
 * zero; a multi-line signature whose parameter list spans lines is the same
 * case (the newline sits at depth > 0) and is handled the same way.
 *
 * `<>` depth is tracked for generic type arguments (`Promise<void>`,
 * `Map<string, number>`) well enough for a parameter list or object type --
 * it is not a real parser and does not need to disambiguate `<` as
 * less-than, which cannot occur in this position in a type annotation.
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION: an arrow-typed parameter's `=>` (`cb: (a: string) => void`)
 * is NOT a `<`/`>` pair, but its `>` still reads as a lone closer under plain
 * counting and drags depth down early, un-hiding the rest of that parameter
 * list's separators. So a `>` immediately after `=` (ignoring the space
 * between them) is treated as part of an arrow token, not a bracket, and
 * leaves depth untouched.
