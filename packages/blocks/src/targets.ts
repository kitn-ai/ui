/**
 * INSTALL ROOTS -- ONE table (spec 2026-09-02 section 3.4), read by the form
 * renderers, by `create-kai add` (PR D) and by the /blocks page (PR C).
 *
 * THE RULING THIS FILE ENFORCES: the path the site DISPLAYS is the path the
 * CLI WRITES, byte for byte. A file tree on a page that does not match where
 * the command puts the file is a lie the reader finds out about after
 * running it.
 *
 * `components/` because every project already has one. No `ui/` or `kai/`
 * namespace: a block is the consumer's code, not a copied primitive, and a
 * namespace directory implies an upstream that owns it.
 *
 * No `node:path` here (this package declares no ambient types on purpose):
 * these are posix paths joined by hand, which is what a project-relative
 * path in a manifest is.
