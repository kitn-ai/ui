// that guard would stay green while the promise got weaker. Every target here
// keeps its own single-entry invocation.

// WHY AN ENV VAR AND NOT `vite build --mode <target>`: --mode also drives
// .env.<mode> loading and Vite's isProduction determination, which feeds

   * Emit one file per SOURCE module instead of one aggregate module.
   *
   * WHY: one 711 kB aggregate module is opaque to a consumer's bundler. Rollup's
   * statement-level DCE cannot remove a module-scope init it cannot prove pure, so
   * `import { cn } from '@kitn.ai/ui'` retained ~121 kB of eager code — `marked`,
   * `lucide-solid` and the rest of the component tree included — no matter what got
   * imported. Per-module output moves that decision to the MODULE graph, where whole
   * modules drop the way they do in any normal dependency. Measured on a scratch app
   * against the packed tarball (Vite 8/Rolldown, minified, eager = statically
   * reachable only): `cn`-only 125,975 -> 28,575 B, `Button`-only 126,253 ->
   * 49,143 B, three components 128,392 -> 50,684 B. In the `cn`-only bundle the
   * remaining modules are `tailwind-merge` (27,922 B), `clsx` (362 B) and
   * utils/cn.js (144 B); `marked` and `lucide-solid` are gone from the output
   * entirely, and the twelve lazy highlighter chunks it used to pull in are gone
   * with them. The `./solid` namespace import (the ceiling) is unchanged, as it
   * should be.
   *
   * WHERE IT IS SET: on all four barrels a consumer resolves — the two client
   * barrels `index` (".") and `solid` ("./solid"), plus their server twins
   * `index.server` and `solid.server` (the `node` / `worker` / `deno` halves of
   * the same exports entries).
   *
   * · `state` / `wire` / `stores` stay aggregate because they are promised
   *   self-contained for a raw CDN URL (see the comment above this table).
   *   Per-module output would replace that self-containment with relative
   *   `./x.js` specifiers, so they are out of scope by contract, not by
   *   measurement.
   * · THE SERVER TWINS, MEASURED. Until the twins were included here, the
   *   `node` / `worker` / `deno` conditions resolved to the aggregate
   *   `dist/index.server.js` (626,182 B) / `dist/solid.server.js`, so an SSR or
   *   serverless consumer paid the same unpurgeable floor this change removed on
   *   the client. Measured on the packed tarball in a scratch app, built under
   *   the `node` condition (Vite 8/Rolldown, minified, eager = entry chunk plus
   *   its static import closure, one probe per invocation): importing `cn` alone
   *   from `@kitn.ai/ui` cost 103,311 B eager against the aggregate
   *   `dist/index.server.js` and 28,353 B against `dist/index.js` under `browser` —
   *   3.6x the client figure for an import that reaches none of it. On the twins
   *   the same probe lands at 28,388 B. The current pair is asserted, not restated:
   *   the `node-cn` probe in EAGER_PROBES
   *   (scripts/verify-consumer-sideeffects.mjs) is where the figures are kept.
   * · THE TWINS MUST NOT LAND ON THE CLIENT'S FILE PATHS. Same entry, same
   *   source modules, different transform: an SSR twin emitting `[name].js` would
   *   overwrite `dist/components/badge.js` with the server transform and
   *   `dist/index.js` would then import it — unobservable in a diff, surfacing as
   *   a client bundle throwing "Client-only API used on the server side". So an
   *   SSR per-module target emits `[name].server.js`, which is also the filename
   *   the `exports` map already names for it. See PER_MODULE_OUTPUT below.
   *
   * ONE CONSEQUENCE TO KNOW ABOUT: this materialises the kit's inlined dependencies
   * as real modules under `dist/node_modules/**` (they are what the consumer's
   * bundler can now drop), which is a nested `node_modules` inside a published
   * package — a path some tooling special-cases or strips. `npm pack` includes it,
   * `verify:consumer` bundles it, and renaming it (e.g. `dist/vendor/`) would be a
   * separate change with its own verification.

  //   1. It emitted dist/wire.d.ts from src/remote/wire.ts (the remote CARD

  //   2. The flattened files kept their ORIGINAL relative imports, so

  // Compiled to dist/construct.js. Sibling of vite.config.schemas.ts (read its

  // with a documented size budget zod does not fit, so this is its own exports
  // key rather than growing "./schemas".
  //
  // `zod` is external, matching vite.config.construct-cli.ts's build (the CLI
  // bundle over the same source tree) — it's a real runtime `dependencies` entry
  // of this package, so any consumer installing @kitn.ai/ui gets it resolved
  // normally, and bundling it a second time here would be dead weight.
  //
  // The .d.ts is NOT emitted by the barrel build (vite.config.barrel.ts): that
  // build's dts `include` is src/**, and this tree lives at mcp/, so it cannot
  // enter that emit at all. (Before the 2026-09-02 move the same source sat at
  // src/agent-tooling/ and was held out by an explicit exclude; the exclude is
  // gone because it could no longer fire.) Keeping it out is still the point:
  // most of mcp/ is Node/MCP-only tooling that must not leak its types into the
  // "." browser entry. So this build carries its own vite-plugin-dts pass
  // instead, scoped to just the two files this entry needs (public.ts + the
  // schema.ts it re-exports). See the outDir/entryRoot comment on the target
  // below for how declarations still land at
  // dist/agent-tooling/construct/public.d.ts, the same "types nested, JS flat"
  // shape "./schemas" already uses (dist/schemas/index.d.ts next to dist/schemas.js).
  //
  // rollupTypes is deliberately NOT set: it invokes api-extractor over the whole
  // already-emitted dist/**/*.d.ts tree (this build runs after the barrel build
  // in the `build` script chain), and it errored trying to resolve dist/state.js
  // (JS, not .d.ts — the sibling .d.ts shim is a POSTbuild step) while walking an
  // unrelated barrel-emitted file (dist/primitives/create-kai-chat.d.ts). Plain
  // per-file declaration emit has no such cross-file dependency and needs none:
  // public.d.ts re-exports from './schema', and schema.d.ts is emitted alongside
  // it by the same include list, so the reference resolves without bundling.
  //
  // url-scheme-policy.ts is NOT in `include`, and does not need to be: schema.ts
  // imports isSafeUrl for a runtime .refine() only, so no emitted declaration
  // references it. Checked, not assumed:
  //   grep -n "url-scheme" dist/agent-tooling/construct/*.d.ts
  // returns nothing. An earlier version of this comment claimed the emit relied
  // on the barrel build having produced dist/primitives/url-scheme-policy.d.ts
  // first; it does not, and that claim would have made this move look blocked.

 * Output options for a `perModule` target. `preserveModulesRoot` is `src/`, so a
 * module keeps its source path under dist/ (src/components/badge/badge.tsx ->
 * dist/components/badge/badge.js) — which is also the layout the barrel's declaration
 * emit has always used (`entryRoot: 'src'`), so every emitted .js now has the
 * .d.ts beside it that a deep import or an editor resolves.
 *
 * `.server` ON THE SSR TWINS, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING. A per-module target rooted
 * at src/ writes one file per source module, and the SSR twins cover the SAME
 * source modules as `index` / `solid`, so `[name].js` on both would have the
 * second build silently overwrite the first one's files and `dist/index.js` would
 * end up importing modules compiled by the SSR transform. That is unobservable in
 * a diff and surfaces as a client bundle throwing "Client-only API used on the
 * server side" — so the suffix belongs on the target the day it is added, not
 * after the failure. It is keyed on the transform because that is the axis the two
 * builds differ on, and `[name].server.js` is also the `fileName` the exports map
 * already names for `index.server` / `solid.server`, so no exports entry moves.
 * The declaration emit is unaffected: it rides the DOM build alone (`entryRoot:
 * 'src'`), and those .d.ts keep their unsuffixed names.
