// The four suites that must NOT run under Storybook, one project each.
//
// Storybook loads Tailwind at DOCUMENT level, which registers the `--tw-*`
// custom properties globally and makes shadow-root rings paint. That is the
// precise condition that hid the focus-ring defect. Each project here serves a
// bare page that loads only the built `dist/` bundle, which is what a real
// consumer app looks like.
//
// Separate from config/playwright/storybook.config.ts because these servers
// must not share a port with Storybook, and separate from
// config/playwright/cross-origin.config.ts because dev:host binds 6006 too.
// `webServer` is a TestConfig option, not a TestProject one, so a config starts
// every server it lists on every run; port collision is what draws the file
// boundaries between the three configs, and it is the only thing that does.
//
// A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, stated because it is a real change: running one
// project boots all four servers. `--project=focus-ring` now also starts the
// two other node harnesses and the Vite static serve on 6013. Playwright has no
// per-project `webServer`, so this is not avoidable within one file, and it is
// cheap: three of the four are the same ~40-line node http server and the
// fourth is a Vite static serve. Measured cost is a couple of seconds on a suite
// whose own ceiling is 180s.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS IN CI, corrected: all FOUR of these projects are required
// gates, not one. The `browser` leg runs `test:focus-ring`,
// `test:message-text-token`, `test:content-brand-bleed` and `test:hovercard` as
// four separate steps (`node scripts/lint-gate-parity.mjs --list` prints the
// set), so the four-server boot is paid four times, not once. Measured against
// the times the deleted configs recorded, the added cost is roughly two seconds
// per step. That is the whole bill and it is not worth restructuring for.
//
// AMENDED 2026-09-18: there are FIVE projects here now, not four. The geometry
// guard (`geometry-token.spec.ts`, `npm run test:geometry-token`) joined the set,
// on its own port (6214), reusing the same node harness. The counts above ("all
// four", "the four-server boot is paid four times", "four separate steps") were
// written when there were four and are left as they were measured rather than
// rewritten into a number nobody re-timed; the reasoning they carry is unaffected.
// Read the real set from `node scripts/lint-gate-parity.mjs --list`, never from a
// count in this comment.
//
// THE PART THAT IS WORTH KNOWING is not the seconds, it is that four CI steps
// now bind the SAME four ports. `reuseExistingServer` is `!process.env.CI`, so
// on CI it is false and every step starts its own servers rather than attaching
// to a neighbour's; Playwright tears down the servers it started when the run
// exits, which is why four sequential steps do not collide. Two consequences:
//
//   1. These steps must stay SEQUENTIAL on one runner. Run two of them
//      concurrently and the second fails to bind. It fails loudly, which is the
//      right direction, but it fails.
//   2. `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` must stay false on CI. Flip it to
//      plain `true` and a server leaked by a hard-killed step would be silently
//      REUSED by the next one -- and these three paint guards measure the built
//      bundle, so they would be measuring whatever `dist/` the leaked server was
//      started against. That is the same stale-bundle failure the globalSetup
//      below exists to prevent, arriving by a route globalSetup cannot see.
//
// globalSetup ENFORCES a fresh dist/ rather than asking politely in a comment.
// It arrived with the hover-card suite, whose header below records why: a
// deliberately broken fix produced a GREEN run against a stale bundle. The other
// three guards here drive dist/ for exactly the same reason and asked for a
// build in prose ("Needs a build first (`nx build ui`)"). Being config-wide, the
// enforcement now covers all four. In CI this is free: the browser leg builds
// the element bundle well before any of these steps.
//
// HOW TO READ THE PER-PROJECT COMMENTS BELOW: each one moved here VERBATIM from
// the config file it came from, so several still say "Standalone config for
// ..." and one still spells a `Run:` line naming a file that no longer exists.
// The decoder is mechanical: the deleted `playwright.<name>.config.ts` is the
// project named `<name>` here. Where a note is newly true after the move it is
// added as an extra line below the verbatim block, never edited into it.

// NOT `__dirname`. The vite configs next door use it and get away with it
// because Vite transpiles a config to CJS before running it; Playwright's TS
// loader keeps this an ES module (packages/ui is "type": "module"), so
// `__dirname` is undefined and the config throws before a single test runs.
