// The nine Storybook-driven browser suites, one project each, one Storybook
// server for all of them.
//
// WHY THESE NINE AND NOT ALL FOURTEEN: `webServer` is a TestConfig option, not
// a TestProject one, so a single config starts every listed server on every
// run. Two of the fourteen bind port 6006 and would collide: Storybook (here)
// and dev:host (config/playwright/cross-origin.config.ts). The three paint
// guards plus hover-card run against bare harness servers and live in
// config/playwright/bare.config.ts. Port conflict is what draws the file
// boundaries, and it is the only thing that does.
//
// KAI_SB_PORT: playwright.audio-visualizer-band-shape.config.ts existed
// entirely because a worktree's run must not attach to the PARENT checkout's
// Storybook on 6006, so it hardcoded 6018. That need is real and it is now
// config-wide: set KAI_SB_PORT once and every suite here moves together,
// instead of one suite having an escape hatch the other eight lack.
//
// THE PRICE OF NINE-IN-ONE, learned on this config's first CI run: one spec
// that THROWS AT MODULE LOAD aborts collection for the entire config, so all
// nine projects report zero tests and exit 1 together. It happened because
// audio-visualizer-ivp.spec.ts called mkdirSync at module scope on a path that
// existed on one developer's mac and not on a Linux runner. A `--project=` run
// is unaffected, because it loads only the files that project matches, which is
// why every existing suite stayed green and nothing else could see it;
// `verify:playwright-projects` is the only thing that lists the whole config,
// so it is the only place that sees this failure or can diagnose it. Its
// message now carries playwright's own output for exactly that reason. Keep
// module scope in these specs free of anything that can fail: derive paths
// there, do the I/O in `beforeAll`.
//
// The webServer command spells storybook out rather than reusing the
// `storybook` npm script, which hardcodes `-p 6006`. Relying on a trailing
// `-p` to override an earlier one is undocumented last-flag-wins behaviour
// that changes across storybook versions.
//
// HOW TO READ THE PER-PROJECT COMMENTS BELOW: each one moved here VERBATIM
// from the config file it came from, so several still name paths like
// `playwright.composer.config.ts` and still say things like "Self-contained:
// starts Storybook on :6006". None of those files exists any more, and the
// server is started once for the whole config rather than per suite. The
// decoder is mechanical: the deleted `playwright.<name>.config.ts` is the
// project named `<name>` here. Each block carries a `Run (current):` line as
// its first line, which is the command that works today; a `Run:` line further
// down is the historical one from the deleted file, kept so the reasoning
// around it stays unedited.

// NOT `__dirname`. The vite configs next door use it and get away with it
// because Vite transpiles a config to CJS before running it; Playwright's TS
// loader keeps this an ES module (packages/ui is "type": "module"), so
// `__dirname` is undefined and the config throws before a single test runs.

       * this file. That is true for the session that just used it, but makes the
       * config silently unusable — a bare `connection refused` with no hint why —
       * for anyone else (a fresh session, CI, Rob running it directly). With

       * restarts or tears it down; if nothing is listening, Playwright starts one
       * itself from the command below and stops it after the run.

       * (`packages/ui/package.json`'s `"storybook": "npm run build:css &&
       * storybook dev -p 6006"`) — that hardcodes port 6006, and relying on a
       * trailing `-p 6018` argument to silently override an earlier `-p 6006`
       * already baked into the script is the kind of undocumented CLI
       * last-flag-wins behaviour that is easy to get wrong across storybook
       * versions. This spells out the equivalent command explicitly instead.
