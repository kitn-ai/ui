/**
 * Standalone Playwright config for the REAL cross-origin Card-transport matrix
 * (NOT @vitest/browser-playwright). Two distinct origins are spun up so the
 * host↔provider postMessage handshake is genuinely cross-origin:
 *
 *   - host page   → http://localhost:6006   (examples/remote-host, Vite)
 *   - provider    → http://localhost:6007   (examples/remote-provider, Vite)
 *
 * The Storybook visual/interaction stories (src/web-components/remote.stories.tsx) run
 * SAME-origin and are covered by `npm run test:storybook`; this suite is the
 * security matrix (origin/source/nonce pinning, auto-height, theme push, fallback)
 * that jsdom and same-origin Storybook can't prove.
 *
 * webServers use the pinned LOCAL vite bin (via npm scripts), never bare `npx`, for
 * hermetic CI. `reuseExistingServer:!CI` lets you keep `dev:host`/`dev:provider`
 * running locally while iterating.
 *
 * WARNING: `dev:host` and Storybook BOTH bind :6006 — do NOT run e2e locally while a
 * Storybook dev server is up, or Playwright (reuseExistingServer) will reuse Storybook
 * as the host and the suite will fail confusingly. Stop Storybook first.
 *
 * This is the one suite that cannot join either of the other two configs:
 * dev:host binds 6006, the same port Storybook binds, and `webServer` is a
 * TestConfig option rather than a TestProject one, so one config would start
 * both and they would collide. The WARNING above is the local form of the same
 * fact.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e` inside packages/ui. There is no longer a
 * `playwright.config.ts` at the package root, so a bare `playwright test` has no
 * default config and fails loudly instead of silently picking a suite.
