/**
 * WHICH `@kitn.ai/ui` a generated project installs.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `generateProject` defaults the emitted
 * package.json's dependency to `^<this package's version>` and npm resolves
 * that from the REGISTRY. That is right for a consumer who installed the kit
 * — and wrong for the person running the CLI out of a source checkout, whose
 * whole reason for running it is source the registry has never seen. On
 * 2026-08-30 `node packages/ui/bin/mcp.js dev --builder` died in the preview
 * with `SyntaxError: … does not provide an export named 'WorkSurface'`:
 * the emitted project pinned `^0.30.0`, npm installed published 0.30.0, and
 * published 0.30.0 predates the component the checkout had just grown. The
 * captures that "worked" only worked because they were driven with an
 * explicit `--ui <local tarball>` — the flag hid the hole rather than
 * closing it.
 *
 * THE RULE. Running from a source CHECKOUT defaults `uiSpec` to that
 * checkout's own build. Running from an INSTALLED package changes nothing at
 * all: same published spec, same output, not one extra line of stdout. An
 * explicit `--ui` always wins over both.
 *
 * MECHANISM: `npm pack` OF THIS CHECKOUT, INSTALLED AS A TARBALL.
 * Three candidates, and the reasoning is recorded because "it copies" and
 * "it is slow" are both cheap to assert and were both wrong here.
 *
 *   file:<the packages/ui DIRECTORY>  — npm SYMLINKS a directory dependency.
 *     The preview's Vite dev server then treats the kit as linked source
 *     living outside its own root, which puts it on the wrong side of
 *     `server.fs.allow` and out of the optimizer's prebundle. Rejected: it
 *     swaps a clear "missing export" failure for an obscure serving one.
 *
 *   npm pack per run — "slow" is the received wisdom and it is FALSE here:
 *     measured at 0.94s for this package. Not the reason to cache.
 *
 *   npm pack, CONTENT-KEYED CACHE (chosen) — the same mechanism
 *     `verify:construct` already drives every cell through
 *     (`node bin/mcp.js eject … --ui <tarball>`), so the local default is the
 *     path with the most coverage in the repo rather than a second one. The
 *     cache is not about the 0.94s: the tarball path goes INTO the emitted
 *     package.json, and `ensureInstalled` re-runs `npm install` whenever that
 *     file's hash changes. A per-run path would re-install on every start
 *     (tens of seconds); a fixed path would leave a rebuilt dist/ silently
 *     un-reinstalled. Keying the filename on dist/'s content fingerprint gets
 *     both: unchanged build → identical path → no install, rebuilt dist →
 *     new path → package.json changes → npm install re-runs on its own.
 *
 * `npm pack` is byte-deterministic for a given tree (verified: two packs of
 * the same dist/ hash identically), so a content-keyed name is stable.
 *
 * NO `npm pack --json` PARSE HERE, deliberately. npm 12 moved that output's
 * top-level container from an array to an object keyed by package name and
 * took down a release; `lint:pack-parse` exists to route every reader through
 * one parser at <repo>/scripts/pack-listing.mjs. That module is a repo-root
 * dev script, not shippable from inside src/, so instead of adding a fifth
 * parse site this file packs into a FRESH EMPTY directory and reads back the
 * single .tgz that lands there. No JSON, no filename convention, nothing for
 * a future npm to move.
