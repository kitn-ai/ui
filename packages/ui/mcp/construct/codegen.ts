 * The `.dark { }` rule for `theme.tokens.dark`, emitted into the shadow
 * `<style>` alongside the accent-contrast block.
 *
 * WHY CSS text and not setProperty: an inline custom property on the host has
 * no mode — dark mode never reaches the host at all. The `theme` attribute
 * defineWebComponent owns drives a `.dark` class on an inner WRAPPER div
 * inside the shadow root (see elements/define.tsx), and the injected kit CSS
 * re-resolves every `--color-*` token on that wrapper (`theme.css`'s
 * `.dark { --color-x: var(--kai-color-x, <dark default>) }` block). So "dark
 * only" is expressible exactly one way: a `.dark`-scoped `--kai-color-*`
 * declaration in a stylesheet INSIDE this shadow root. It works because the
 * wrapper's OWN `.dark`-rule value beats the light value inherited from the
 * host's setProperty when the kit's `.dark` block re-resolves `--color-*`
 * there — and with no `.dark` class (light mode) the rule matches nothing.
 *
 * These values land in generated CSS TEXT, not an opaque setProperty string,
 * so — same conservative posture as the generated `:host` contrast block,
 * which only ever interpolates a computed `#000000`/`#ffffff` — every name
 * and value is re-asserted here against the same policy the schema doorway
 * enforced (theme-token-policy.ts). validateConstruct is the only doorway to
 * codegen, so a throw here is unreachable in normal operation; it exists
 * because the `Construct` TYPE alone does not prove validation ran.

  // "wired": an earlier version set it on a div INSIDE App's own render.

  // `ctx.element` (the facade's second argument) IS the host, so this sets it

  // browsers without CSS contrast-color() (Baseline Newly Available April
  // 2026 — Chrome/Edge 147, Firefox 146, Safari 26; Widely Available is not
  // until ~2028, and this widget embeds in arbitrary sites), and (2) inside
  // `@supports (color: contrast-color(red))`, the NATIVE answer
  // (contrast-color(var(--kai-color-primary))), which wins where supported —
  // including for an accent this codegen couldn't parse. An inline
  // `style.setProperty` always beats a stylesheet rule (short of
  // `!important`), so achieving "the native answer wins where present" needs
  // both layers to be plain `:host {}` declarations in one stylesheet, base

  // without contrast-color(). Computed BEFORE the gate, and the gate is on

// focus styling by hand: every prior version of this file that hand-composed
// Thread + PromptInput + Button was restating layout the kit already owns,
// and every visual defect the owner hit (flush composer, a clipped focus
// ring) traced back to that restatement. Composing ChatThread directly
// leaves NOTHING here to restate it with.
//
// Capability gating (format rule: an undeclared capability's affordance must
// be OFF). The construct schema carries ONE capability field so far
// (capabilities.starters, Task 8) — every other affordance below is gated to
// "off" unconditionally, not per-construct, until there's a field to gate ON.
//   - webSearch / voice: real ChatThreadProps booleans, default OFF when
//     omitted — set to \`false\` explicitly rather than left implicit, so the
//     gating decision is visible in the emitted source, not just inferred
//     from an absent prop.
//   - suggestions: ChatThread ALREADY owns starter prompts end to end — its
//     own \`suggestions\` prop renders the chips, hides them once
//     \`messages\` is non-empty, and (default \`suggestionMode="submit"\`)
//     calls \`onSubmit\` with the clicked text exactly like a typed submit.
//     So capabilities.starters threads straight into that prop; there is
//     nothing to hand-compose. Omitted (undefined) when no starters are
//     declared, same off-by-default effect as the booleans above.
//   - models: omitted (undefined) — no model switcher; no capabilities field yet.
//   - attachments (the paperclip): gated via ChatThread's \`attach\`/\`accept\`
//     props (kit gap closed — ChatThread forwards both to DefaultPromptInput,
//     mirroring webSearch/voice). ChatThread ALREADY owns the whole
//     round-trip end to end — the paperclip button, staged previews, staging
//     each file as a data URI (never a blob object URL; see
//     AttachmentData.url's doc in primitives/attachment-types.ts), and
//     handing the staged list back via onSubmit's \`attachments\` — and its
//     Message component ALREADY groups consecutive file parts into one
//     attachment row (message.tsx). So there is nothing to hand-compose
//     here, same lesson as suggestions above: hand-rolling a second picker or
//     a second file-part renderer would restate what ChatThread/Message
//     already own. capabilities.attachments threads straight into
//     attach/accept; the only App.tsx-owned piece is folding the picked
//     attachments into the outgoing message's parts at the submit site
//     (see emitProviderSetup) since createKaiChat's own append/streamAssistant
//     ops don't do that folding themselves.
//   - reasoning: gated via ChatThread's own \`reasoning\` prop (kit gap closed
//     — ChatThread forwards it to every MessageBody as \`reasoningMode\`,
//     mirroring attach/accept). \`'full'\` is both the schema default and
//     ChatThread's own default, so it and an absent field emit no prop at
//     all — the SAME off-by-default convention as every other capability
//     here, just anchored on the medium's existing default instead of an
//     "off" value, since a reasoning disclosure is normal chat behavior, not
//     an opt-in affordance like the paperclip or a starter chip.
//   - empty (the welcome-screen greeting, Task 14): gated via ChatThread's
//     own \`emptyContent\` prop, plain JSX rendered in the SAME shadow tree
//     this file's App already composes ChatThread inside of (see
//     emitEmptyContentProp's own doc for why that boundary needs no Portal
//     at all). \`capabilities.starters\`' chips and the composer still render
//     underneath it: ChatThread's own doc comment on \`emptyContent\` is
//     explicit that it replaces only the empty MESSAGE LIST.
//   - the widget close control (owner feedback on the live demo): a declared
//     \`header.title\` on a \`widget\` layout gets its close button threaded
//     into ChatThread's own header row via \`headerEndContent\`, wired back to
//     Dock's \`controllerRef\` seam through a local closure — see
//     emitDockCloseVar/emitHeaderEndContentProp's docs. No header means no
//     row for it to sit in, so that case is untouched and Dock's own built-in
//     mobile X keeps covering it.
//   - conversations (Task 5): gated via ChatThread's own \`conversations\`/
//     \`store\` props (kit-owned end to end — the prior-conversations list,
//     list/load/save, autosave on every \`chat.messages()\` change). Requires
//     capabilities.history persistence \`local\` or \`endpoint\` (schema
//     superRefine, C-4) and SUBSUMES this file's hand-rolled history effect
//     when on — see emitHistorySetup's own doc for the persistence-ownership
//     decision: the store prop is the ONLY persistence mechanism emitted,
//     never both. ChatThread never mutates \`messages\` itself, so
//     \`onConversationLoad\` is ALSO wired here (\`chat.setMessages(() =>
//     messages)\`) — without it, select/new/mount-restore all update
//     ChatThread's own internal view/list state while the rendered thread
//     never changes (see emitConversationsProps's own doc for the Task 6
//     live-browser bug this fixes).
//   - conversations + widget (owner follow-up): closing the widget while its
//     list view is open must not leave it there for the next open — see
//     widgetHasConversationsChrome/emitDockOnOpenChangeProp's docs. Wired only
//     for \`widget\`, the one layout with something that closes/reopens at all.

 * Composed from `Thread` (the message-list primitive, no composer/header/
 * suggestions of its own — components/thread/thread.tsx) + the `PromptInput`
 * compound primitive, NOT `ChatThread`: `ChatThread` bundles its composer
 * INSIDE itself (`DefaultPromptInput`, internal-only), which leaves no seam to
 * splice a slot between the thread and the input the way this layout's
 * placement rule needs. This is the one layout where hand-composing the spine
 * is correct rather than a restatement — every other layout in this file
 * wraps `ChatThread` precisely to avoid this hand-composition (see emitApp's
 * doc comment above).
 *
 * Slot placement is a fixed, deterministic rule, spelled out in the emitted
 * comment: the FIRST declared slot sits above the thread, every other
 * declared slot sits below the composer, in declaration order. There is no
 * vocabulary for a different arrangement (a `position` per slot, an
 * interleaved grain) — reordering means ejecting and rearranging the JSX by
 * hand, which this format's own rule already commits to (no code-in-JSON).
 *
 * Capability gating: only cards are wired here (`Thread` accepts `cardTypes`
 * natively, same as `ChatThread`). starters/attachments/reasoning/
 * reasoningOpen/header.title/empty/conversations are NOT wired for `custom`
 * in v1 — `Thread`/`PromptInput` don't carry the kit's own plumbing for
 * those (they live inside `ChatThread`'s composer, or — for conversations —
 * ChatThread itself owns the list/load/save wiring), and hand-rolling a
 * second copy here is exactly the restatement this file avoids everywhere
 * else. Decided loudly in the emitted comment below, not silently: this is
 * the eject artifact, so a construct author who needs one of them on
 * `custom` adds it directly to the plain Solid file they now own.
 * capabilities.history persistence itself IS still honored on `custom` (the
 * hand-rolled effect below), independent of whether conversations is also
 * set — see emitHistorySetup's own doc for why `custom` keeps it.

 * `shell.commandPalette`, the user cluster follows `shell.userMenu` (its

 * `header.actions`, and the title is `header.title`.
 *
 * MENU-HONESTY: every piece is emitted with its MECHANISM attached, and the
 * component itself renders nothing for a piece whose mechanism is missing —
 * so search is emitted only alongside the palette this file actually writes
 * (`hasShellPalette`), and there is no path here that produces a control with
 * nothing behind it.

 *  load/new/restore updated ChatThread's internal bookkeeping (active id, list
 *  entry) while the actually-rendered `chat.messages()` never changed — the
 *  exact silent-drop class this codebase's CLAUDE.md calls out ("decide
 *  loudly"), except here the drop was an OMITTED wire, not a decision: "+ New
 *  conversation" appeared to do nothing (same messages kept rendering) and a
 *  reload's mount-time auto-restore updated the list's active row but left the
 *  chat view on the empty/welcome screen. `chat.setMessages(() => messages)`
 *  closes the loop — ChatThread already hands back a FRESH array reference on
 *  every call (`[...messages]` at both call sites in chat-thread.tsx), so no
 *  extra clone is needed here; the updater-returns-new-array form is what the

/**
 * The layout shell wrapping ChatThread — one pair (open above, close below)
 * per `layout`, composing the kit's own layout primitives over a hand-rolled
 * div wherever the kit ships one:
 *
 *  - `widget`: the kit's Dock (launcher + panel + focus contract) — unchanged
 *    from before Task 12. No theming wrapper needed here — the accent lands
 *    on the HOST element from element.tsx's facade (see emitElement), which
 *    reaches both the launcher (a DOM sibling of this panel content, outside
 *    Dock's own `children`) and everything below via normal custom-property
 *    inheritance from :host down through the whole shadow tree.
 *  - `fullscreen`: the kit has no dedicated "fill the viewport" component —
 *    this genuinely is just sizing, not chrome — so a minimally-styled
 *    `<div>` (100dvh, column flex) IS the honest composition, not a
 *    restatement of something the kit already owns.
 *  - `aside`: same reasoning — a persistent, single-edge docked panel is a
 *    styled container (fixed inline-end column, the kit's own
 *    `--kai-color-border` token for the divider), not a kit component. `dvh`/
 *    logical properties (`inset-inline-end`, `border-inline-start`) keep it
 *    correct under RTL and mobile viewport chrome the same way `100dvh` does
 *    for fullscreen.
 *  - `split`: composes the kit's real `WorkspaceShell` (components/
 *    workspace-shell.tsx) for its frame -- chat in `children` (the main
 *    region), the end pane's `<slot name="pane">` seam projected via `end`.
 *    Superseded from Task 12's `PaneGroup` (recorded decision 2): `PaneGroup`
 *    is an editor GROUP contract (src/components/pane/pane-group.tsx) -- a tab strip over
 *    ONE content area -- so getting two SIMULTANEOUS panes out of it meant a
 *    single always-active tab whose one body was a hand-rolled flex row doing
 *    the actual two-column math; the "kit component" was supplying a frame
 *    the composition didn't use for its defining feature (a resizable split)
 *    at all. `WorkspaceShell` already IS a two-region layout with a REAL
 *    draggable splitter between them (it composes `ResizablePanelGroup`
 *    internally) -- start/end aside width props and collapse are left at
 *    their defaults here (this construct wants exactly one fixed end pane,
 *    not a full workspace chrome); `drawerBelow={480}` IS wired (Task 19d) so
 *    split gets the kit's own mobile takeover at the same breakpoint every
 *    other layout uses, so the split's math is the kit's
 *    own, not a restatement.
 *
 * `custom` is handled entirely by `emitCustomApp` instead (its spine is
 * Thread + PromptInput composed by hand, not ChatThread, so there's no shared
 * chrome to open/close here) — `emitApp` special-cases it before either of
 * these is called. Both switches still carry a `case 'custom'` so they stay
 * exhaustive over the widened layout enum: TypeScript is what caught this
 * exact gap when Task 13 added the enum member, and a `default` would have
 * hidden it again for the next one.

 * Vite treats a fresh mtime on vite.config.ts as a restart signal, so `dev`'s
 * regen-per-edit was restarting the preview server on EVERY construct edit,
 * and at live-theming frequency a restart landing mid-iframe-reload strands
 * the preview on a dead page.
 *
 * The skip lives HERE, inside writeProject, and the prune manifest is still
 * built from the FULL emitted-file list — never from the subset that changed.
 * An earlier attempt filtered the file list UPSTREAM (dev.ts handing
 * writeProject only the changed files), and since writeProject prunes
 * everything its manifest doesn't cover, the subset deleted the rest of the
 * project. Reverted; do not reintroduce it.
