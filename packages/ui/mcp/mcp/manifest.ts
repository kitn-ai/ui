// `CardComponentMap` from src/primitives/card-registry.TSX, and pulling a .tsx into
// this pass would mean giving tsconfig.mcp.json `jsx` + `jsxImportSource` + the DOM
// lib, dragging the whole Solid component tree into a Node-only project — measured
// as 0 errors -> 1364. Those two types moved to the DOM-free
// src/primitives/card-component-types.ts, so a relative import of the barrel would
// typecheck here today. It stays on the public specifier anyway, because emitting
// and consuming the same string is the point of this module. The built entry
// resolves to dist/schemas/index.d.ts, whose own reference to card-registry is a
// .d.ts that skipLibCheck skips, so the Node/no-DOM guarantee survives intact.

// `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` is the authoritative `CardEnvelope.type -> kai-* tag` map and
// arrives here as DATA, not a type. It is authored in src/primitives/card-tags.ts,

// Node/no-DOM project rather than only through this built entry. Before that split it
// shared a module with `BUILTIN_CARD_COMPONENTS` and this module re-derived it by
// convention instead; see `cardTagForType`.
//
// This costs a build before typecheck and before the unit suite. That is not a new
// dependency: resolveManifestPath() below already requires dist/custom-elements.json,

// THE MANIFEST IS THIS PACKAGE'S OWN BUILD ARTIFACT, SO IT IS ADDRESSED, NOT SEARCHED

// `<dir>/dist/custom-elements.json` it found, and that is a categorically weaker

// package's custom-elements.json exists" are different facts, and a walk-up cannot
// tell them apart. It reports success for both.
//
// It was not hypothetical. Measured from an agent git worktree at
// `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<agent>/packages/ui/mcp/mcp`, the loop
// climbed past the worktree's own (unbuilt) `packages/ui/dist`, out of the worktree
// entirely, and bound on iteration 8 to `<repo>/dist/custom-elements.json` — a
// leftover from the pre-monorepo layout, six weeks stale, 78 tags, and zero elements
// declaring `cardSchemas`. The consequence is this repo's dominant failure mode in
// its purest form: on an unbuilt tree the MCP manifest tests did not error, they
// PASSED, 16 of 17, against an artifact from a tree nobody was working in. Two
// checkouts could disagree about what they had tested and nothing said so.

 *
 * WHY IT IS READ AND NOT DERIVED. Stripping `kai-` is wrong for ten of the eighty

 * catch. The fact is stated in config/vite/elements.ts, which adds an explicit
 * entry for each opt-in element precisely "so `@kitn.ai/ui/elements/remote`

//                 These get the wiring note, not a schema.

 * `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas`. This function used to RE-DERIVE it by convention — the tag
 * is `kai-<t>` when that element exists, else the single element whose tag starts
 * `kai-<t>-` — which was correct against all 80 tags on this tree, `link` ->

 * with no element behind it (a rename that missed this file) would otherwise have
 * `component_reference` send a harness to an element that does not exist. Entries with
