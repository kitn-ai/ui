/**
 * The `serverInfo` every MCP harness reads back on `initialize`. READ, NOT TYPED.
 *
 * This was a hand-typed `{ name: '@kitn.ai/ui', version: '0.15.0' }` and the kit kept
 * releasing past it, so every harness that connected was told a version ten minors
 * stale — the same "derive it, don't type it" failure as the CDN pins, minus their
 * lint. Nothing here is allowed to restate the version: `server.test.ts` reads
 * package.json off disk itself and compares.
 *
 * RESOLVED BY THE PACKAGE'S OWN NAME, not by path arithmetic. This module runs from
 * two places — `<package>/mcp/mcp/server.ts` under vitest, and inlined
 * into `<package>/dist/mcp.es.js` for the bin — which sit at different depths, so a
 * relative hop would need one rule per context (what manifest.ts has to do, because
 * `dist/custom-elements.json` is a build artifact with no name to ask for). A
 * self-reference has no depth to get wrong: Node resolves `@kitn.ai/ui/package.json`
 * against the nearest package.json whose `name` matches, which is this package in
 * both contexts and in an install. It also never escapes into a neighbouring
 * checkout the way a parent-directory search can.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVES PUBLISHING. npm always ships package.json, `exports` carries
 * `"./package.json": "./package.json"` (self-reference is restricted to the exports
 * map, so that key is load-bearing — drop it and this throws, and the test goes red
 * with it), and `bin/mcp.js` imports `../dist/mcp.es.js` by its own URL, so the
 * resolver starts inside the installed package however it was launched (npx, global
 * install, symlink). Not a JSON import: that inlines the version at BUILD time, which
 * is a second copy that can disagree with the package.json shipped beside it, and it
 * would need `resolveJsonModule` on the repo's browser tsc pass as well as this one.
 *
 * A broken resolve throws instead of falling back to a placeholder — `bin/mcp.js`
 * turns that into a named fatal on stderr, which is the loud version. A wrong version
 * silently announced to every harness is the quiet one.
