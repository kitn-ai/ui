/**
 * scaffold — the keystone tool. Composes a working chat surface from four axes:
 *
 *   components × integration × placement × framework
 *
 * and emits three labeled blocks an AI consumer can paste straight in:
 *   (1) Front-end  — the surface's kai-* components, rendered for the chosen
 *                    framework and sized for the placement, wired with the
 *                    `messages` property + `kai-submit` per the Streaming recipe.
 *   (2) Backend    — the integration's route template for the framework (with a
 *                    language-aware fallback when there's no exact match).
 *   (3) Run note   — how to run it + the env vars to set.
 *
 * THE SURFACE AXIS IS A COMPONENTS LIST, NOT AN ARCHETYPE ID, AND THAT IS THE
 * POINT OF THIS FILE'S SHAPE.
 *
 * It used to be an archetype id, and that made the six presets the whole of the
 * expressible space: `agentic` and `workspace` differ by nothing except which
 * components compose, so a builder who wanted both — a resizable artifact pane
 * that ALSO renders the tool calls that produced the artifact — could not ask for
 * it, and neither could `create-kai`'s feature multi-select. Adding a seventh
 * preset for every such combination is 2^n presets in the limit.
 *
 * So `renderSurface({ framework, components, integration })` is the renderer, the
 * archetypes are DATA over it (a preset is a named components list plus a default
 * placement), and there is exactly one of each. `create-kai` imports the same
 * function rather than growing a second one — a parallel renderer is the specific
 * failure this extraction exists to prevent, which is why
 * `assertPresetsAreData` in scripts/verify-scaffold-compiles.mjs asserts that a
 * preset request and a components request emit byte-identical surfaces.
 *
 * The handler is called directly in tests (bypassing MCP's zod validation), so it
 * validates `useCase` + `integration` against the registry itself and returns
 * graceful, self-correcting error text when either is unknown.

/**
 * full-page, and it has to be true in a STOCK starter — not just in an empty page.
 *
 * It used to be `height: 100dvh; width: 100%`, which is full-page only if nothing
 * above it interferes, and in the templates consumers actually run something
 * always does. Two frameworks hit it independently:
 *
 *   · Vite's `react-ts` template ships `#root { max-width: 1280px; margin: 0 auto;
 *     padding: 2rem; text-align: center }`, so the chat was capped, inset by 2rem
 *     and had its text centred — inherited straight through the shadow boundary.
 *   · The official TanStack Start starter renders a Header (73px) and a Footer
 *     (181px) around every route in `__root.tsx`, so a 100dvh sibling put the
 *     composer 13px BELOW the fold at 1280x800.
 *
 * `position: fixed; inset: 0` is the one fix that works for both without a
 * per-framework patch: it takes the surface out of flow entirely, so an ancestor's
 * width cap, padding and flex centring stop applying and a sibling header/footer
 * stops consuming height. `text-align: start` is still needed because text-align
 * INHERITS regardless of positioning.
 *
 * `z-index` matters as much as the positioning. Without it the surface stacks at
 * `auto`, and the TanStack starter's header is `sticky top-0 z-50` — so the chat
 * would sit at the right geometry and still have the top 73px of its thread
 * painted over. Half-covered is the worst outcome available: either the chat owns
 * the viewport or it does not.
 *
 * WHY 90 AND NOT 1000 (F-20's scaffold-side sibling). The kit's `kai-toast-region`
 * — which `toast()` mounts as a body-level SIBLING of the app root — paints its
 * stack at `z-index: var(--kai-toast-z, 100)`, and both layers live in the root
 * stacking context. Every fixed placement here used to stamp `z-index: 1000`, so
 * every scaffolded app buried every toast (Undo included) under its own wrapper —
 * the exact defect the corpus workspace app's IVP caught in its builder CSS.
 * 90 still outranks any sticky starter chrome (z-50 is the highest observed) and
 * stays below the toast layer; the emitted comment states the contract so a
 * consumer raising the wrapper knows what they are burying.
 *
 * The trade is stated in the emitted comment rather than hidden: this overlays
 * whatever the starter draws around it, nav included. A consumer who wants the chat
 * inside their layout wants `placement: 'inline'`, which is what that placement is for.

 * had no way to obtain — `history` never contains the assistant message, the
 * `messages` closure is stale by construction, and `AssistantStream` is
 * write-only. So the archetype's headline capability could not be completed by
 * uncommenting, or by any amount of local editing.
 *
 * Live, with a `runTool` stub that answers the one tool the scaffold declares,
 * it runs end to end on the first submit: the panel reaches `output-available`
 * and the model's answer streams into the same message, after the tool part, as
 * a new text part.
 *
 * Both rounds drive the SAME `AssistantStream`, so the whole exchange folds into
 * one assistant message with its parts in stream order — which is what
 * `toOpenAIMessages` splits back into `assistant(tool_calls) → tool → assistant`
 * on the way out.

 * `function.parameters`, Anthropic puts it at `input_schema`, and `jsonschema`
 * returns a bare `{name, description, schema}` that `ai@7`'s `jsonSchema()` takes

 * (worse) ignores the tool and the card silently never arrives.
 *
 * READ OFF THE INTEGRATION, not inferred. This used to be a table keyed on
 * `streamFormat`, and that table was wrong in a way only `anthropic` made
 * visible: `streamFormat` describes the RESPONSE stream, the tool envelope is a
 * REQUEST concern, and the two only looked correlated while every integration
 * that forwarded tools happened to be `openai-sse`. `anthropic` is
 * `streamFormat: 'native'`, the table mapped `native` to `null`, and a null here
 * means a scaffold that hands the model a tools array with no card in it.
 *
 * Nor is the fix "key on the provider instead". Anthropic's emitted route
 * CONVERTS the array itself — `toAnthropicTools` reads `raw.function.name` and
 * `raw.function.parameters` — so it wants the OPENAI envelope even though it
 * POSTs to api.anthropic.com. Only the route knows its own request contract, so
 * the integration declares it (`clientToolFormat`), exactly as it already
 * declares `forwardsFromClient`.
 *
 * `null` here means the integration does not forward a tools array at all, which
 * is the honest state for langgraph/mastra/pi/vercel-ai-sdk (their routes own the
 * tool list server-side). It can no longer mean "forwards tools, envelope
 * unknown": `IntegrationSchema` rejects that combination at the catalog boundary,
 * `assertCardToolFormat` below refuses to emit it, and `scaffold.test.ts` +

 * right when #190 made `text/*`, `application/json`, `application/xml` and YAML
 * encodable. The list did not become wrong in this file — it became wrong in

 * a harder case than the prose in `ATTACHMENT_WIRE_NOTE` only in that a comment
 * can point at a function and an attribute has to CONTAIN the answer; the fix is
 * the same either way, which is to read the declaration rather than restate it.
 *
 * WHY EMIT IT AT ALL, RATHER THAN NOTHING. An absent filter means the full
 * capability set to `resolveMediaPolicy`, so omitting looks equivalent and is
 * not, because the tags emitted here never call it. `<kai-file-upload>` (and the
 * Solid `<FileUpload>`) pass `accept` straight to `<input type="file">` and do no
 * JS filtering at all — unlike `<kai-chat accept>`, which resolves the policy in
 * `default-input.tsx`. So on THESE tags an absent attribute is not the capability
 * set, it is wider than the capability set: the dialog offers `.zip`, the emitted
 * `toAttachment` stages it, and the encoder throws on a file the picker
 * volunteered. Deriving the attribute is the only form that tracks the
 * declaration; omitting it is a third behaviour that matches neither layer.
 *
 * IT IS A STEER, NOT A GATE, and nothing here should be read as claiming
 * otherwise. `accept` filters the OS dialog, which always offers an "All Files"
 * escape, and it does not apply to drag-and-drop — `file-upload.tsx` hands
 * `dataTransfer.files` straight to `onFilesAdded`. A scaffolded app that wants a

 * the model. That is worth stating because it was false for a long time and the
 * failure was silent: before #186 an attachment-only turn encoded to nothing at
 * all and was dropped from the request, so a scaffold could put a paperclip on
 * screen, accept a PDF, render it in the thread, and send the model a message
 * that never mentioned it.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO. Both remaining limits are facts about the APIs, not
 * gaps in this scaffold, which is why the emitted note can state them plainly:
 *   · Neither API has an arbitrary-file content block, so a media type outside
 *     the kit's set — a `.zip` is the one people try — has no representation on
 *     either wire and throws at encode time rather than going missing.
 *   · A REMOTE text file is refused. Text has to ride as text CONTENT (no wire
 *     has a URL form for it), so inlining one would mean fetching it, and
 *     `wire/` does no I/O by design. Stage a `data:` URI instead.
 * A file the browser could not name is NOT on that list any more: it is settled
 * by decoding its bytes, so the `.rs` and `.toml` files a coding chat is full of
 * go through even though Chrome hands them over with no media type at all.
 *
 * ★ THE EMITTED NOTE MUST NOT NAME MEDIA TYPES, and that is the whole reason it
 * reads the way it does. It lands in a user's repo, where it outlives any
 * limitation it describes and where nothing can ever check it — a second copy of
 * the capability list, at the worst possible layer. It points at
 * `encodableMediaTypes()` instead, which is public precisely so that nobody has
 * to hardcode the set. A guard in `scaffold.test.ts` fails if a media type
 * creeps back into it.
 *
 * This very comment has been wrong before, in the way that matters most: #186
 * corrected the emitted string and left the explanation above it teaching the
 * reverse, so the scaffolder's own documentation said files never reach the
 * model while the code it emitted said they do. Anything written here that a
 * script cannot re-derive is a claim with a shelf life.

/**
 * The `html` target's logic, as a REAL `src/main.ts` module.
 *
 * SCAF-19 used to inline this as plain JS inside `<script type="module">` in
 * index.html, on the reasoning that the wiring sets untyped properties on a raw
 * `customElements` reference and would need a hand-cast per property. Being
 * invisible to tsc was described as the benefit.
 *
 * It was the defect. The canonical getting-started path
 * (`npm create vite -- --template vanilla-ts`) builds with `tsc && vite build`
 * and its tsconfig is `"include": ["src"]`, so the consumer's own build
 * type-checked NONE of the scaffold's logic. Proven rather than argued: an
 * injected call to a function that does not exist anywhere left `npm run build`
 * exiting 0 in a stock app.
 *
 * The hand-cast worry does not survive contact either — the kit SHIPS the web-component
 * interfaces, so one `as KaiChatElement` at the lookup types every property that
 * follows, which is what the svelte and angular targets already do. And the
 * message type comes from the element itself
 * (`KaiChatElement['messages'][number]`) instead of the hand-written local subset
 * the other mock targets declare: derived from the property it is assigned to, it
 * cannot drift out of step with it.
 *
 * Moving the logic into `src/` also retires the TS18003 workaround the old note
 * carried. That error existed only because deleting the template's `src/main.ts`
 * left `src/` with no `.ts` files at all; this scaffold now IS `src/main.ts`.

/**
 * TanStack Start: emits a file-based route (`src/routes/chat.tsx`) that renders
 * the Chat surface client-only via `ssr: false` on `createFileRoute`.
 *
 * Verified pattern: `ssr: false` prevents the Solid-based web-component runtime
 * from running on the server — no `window is not defined` crash, no hydration
 * mismatch. A per-web-component ENTRY is not import-safe that way (it defines its
 * element at module eval, and most of them touch `window` there), so the emitted
 * imports sit inside a `typeof window` guard; only the register-all barrel would
 * be safe to import at the top level.
 *
 * Scaffold command (official TanStack CLI, non-interactive):
 *   npx @tanstack/cli@latest create <app-name> --framework react --no-git --package-manager npm -y
 *
 * After scaffolding, install what block (3) lists — `@kitn.ai/ui` plus whatever
 * the chosen integration's route imports, which this renderer cannot know and so
 * no longer guesses — then drop this file into `src/routes/chat.tsx`. Start the
 * dev server with `npm run dev` (port 3000).
 * Build: `npm run build`; preview: `npm run preview` (or `node dist/server/server.js`).
 * Note: `npm start` does NOT exist in TanStack Start projects — use `npm run dev` / `npm run preview`.
 *
 * Backend: the emitted front end fetches `/api/chat`, so it needs a SERVER ROUTE,
 * not a server function. In TanStack Start that is a file route carrying a
 * `server.handlers` block — `src/routes/api/chat.ts` with
 * `createFileRoute('/api/chat')({ server: { handlers: { POST } } })`. Block (2)
 * emits exactly that. This comment used to name `createServerFn` and
 * `src/server/chat.ts`, which can never answer a `fetch('/api/chat')`: the two
 * halves of the same scaffold contradicted each other.

/**
 * Angular: the `kai-*` custom elements, same as vue/svelte/html — plus the two
 * things Angular needs and no other framework does.
 *
 *   1. `schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]` on the component. Without it the
 *      template compiler REJECTS every unknown tag ("'kai-chat' is not a known
 *      element") and `ng build` fails outright. With it, Angular stamps the tag
 *      and passes the bindings straight through to the DOM.
 *   2. `[messages]="messages()"` — the square brackets are what make it a DOM
 *      PROPERTY. `messages="…"` would be an ATTRIBUTE, i.e. the string
 *      "[object Object]": arrays and objects only ever reach a custom element as
 *      properties. Same for `[suggestions]` and `[loading]`.
 *
 * Two Angular-specific facts the emitted comments carry, because getting either
 * wrong is a build error rather than a subtle bug:
 *
 *   · Stylesheets come from `angular.json` -> architect.build.options.styles.
 *     `@angular/build` does not take a TS `import './x.css'`, so the theme
 *     cannot be imported the way every other framework imports it here.
 *   · `$event` on an unknown custom-element event is typed `Event` under
 *     `strictTemplates`, not `CustomEvent`, so the handler takes an `Event` and
 *     narrows inside — exactly what examples/starters/angular does.
 *
 * The thread is an Angular signal, which reads back synchronously, so this uses
 * `accessorThreadBinding` and not React's turn-scoped `thread` copy.

/**
 * SolidJS — the one target that does NOT render `kai-*`.
 *
 * The kit is AUTHORED in Solid, so a Solid consumer imports the real components
 * from the `@kitn.ai/ui` root entry and gets real props and real fine-grained
 * reactivity. Routing it through the web-component facade would ship the Solid
 * runtime twice and put a reactive-context boundary in the middle of the app for
 * no gain.
 *
 * THE GRANULARITY GAP. `<kai-chat>` is a coarse preset: one tag renders the
 * thread, the parts, the scroll behaviour, the suggestions and the composer. The
 * Solid layer is fine-grained — ChatContainer / Message / MessageContent /
 * PromptInput / … — so the same capability has to be composed here. Two
 * consequences the emitted code has to handle, and both are silent failures if
 * it does not:
 *
 *   1. The thread renders exactly what `renderPart` renders, so `renderPart` has
 *      to carry a branch for EVERY variant of `MessagePart`. `<kai-chat>` owns
 *      that switch internally; a hand-composed tree that only handles `text`
 *      shows nothing when a reasoning or tool part streams in. A missing branch
 *      is not a type error — a `<Switch>` with fewer `<Match>`es compiles fine —
 *      it is a part that arrives in the data and renders nothing, which is how
 *      `card` and `source` were silently dropped here while this very paragraph
 *      claimed otherwise. `solidPartCoverageCheck` in
 *      scripts/verify-scaffold-compiles.mjs now derives the variant list from
 *      the `MessagePart` union and fails the build when one has no branch. The
 *      part renderer is emitted for EVERY archetype, not just the agentic one —
 *      the stream can produce any variant regardless of which components the
 *      archetype names.
 *   2. The components are Tailwind-v4 SOURCE, not shadow-encapsulated CSS. The
 *      class names have to survive into the consumer's stylesheet, which is what
 *      the `@source` line in the setup note is for. Without it Tailwind scans
 *      only `src/`, strips every kit class as unused, and the app renders
 *      unstyled — see examples/starters/solid/README.md.
 *
 * Solid signals read back synchronously, so this uses `accessorThreadBinding`
 * and not React's turn-scoped `thread` copy.

 * an agent or a developer copying "the component" copies that pair, and the one

 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, measured rather than assumed. On Vue 3.5.39, skipping it
 * does NOT blank the page: Vue falls back to rendering the unresolved tag as a
 * native element, and its runtime sets `key in el` bindings as DOM properties, so
 * a scaffold built from this output still runs — verified in a stock `vue-ts` app
 * in dev AND in a production build, with and without the `.prop` modifiers, and
 * the mock reply streamed in every time. What you get instead is
 *
 *   [Vue warn]: Failed to resolve component: kai-chat
 *
 * on every kai-* tag in development, which reads like a bug and is the exact
 * warning Vue tells you to fix with `compilerOptions.isCustomElement`.
 *
 * So the emitted copy says that, and does not claim a blank page it cannot
 * produce. Overstating it would be worse than the buried comment was: the first
 * developer to skip the step and find their app working stops believing the rest
 * of the scaffold.
 *
 * The whole file is emitted rather than a fragment because the plugin list is
 * where this collides with block (2): a Vite SPA's dev API route adds
 * `chatApiPlugin()` to the SAME array, and a consumer who pastes one config over
 * the other silently loses whichever came first. The emitted comment says so.

/**
 * The install command, DERIVED from the catalog's `deps`.
 *
 * `deps` was declared by all eleven integrations and consumed by nothing: the
 * schema typed it, `registry.test.ts` checked its SHAPE, and the fact a developer
 * actually needs — which packages to install — lived a SECOND time as prose in
 * each integration's `runNote`. Two copies of one fact drift silently, and both
 * copies already had: langgraph's prose named three packages where `deps.npm`
 * carries four (it never mentioned `zod`, which its route imports and its app
 * therefore fails to build without), and pydantic-ai's named three where
 * `deps.pip` carries four (it never mentioned `pydantic`, which its route
 * imports). Nothing could catch either, because nothing compared them.
 *
 * So the prose is gone and this is the only place the scaffold names a package.
 * `registry.test.ts` pins `deps.npm` to the imports of the route's own source, so
 * the line below cannot drift from the code printed above it either.
 *
 * `@kitn.ai/ui` leads and is deliberately in no integration's `deps`: it is the
 * kit, a dependency of every scaffold whatever the backend, so declaring it
 * per-integration would be eleven copies of one constant.
 *
 * Only what the emitted CODE imports is listed. The host a route runs on (Express,
 * an Angular SSR server, a Vite dev server) comes from the app template the
 * developer created, not from here.
