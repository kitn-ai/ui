/**
 * Whether this integration's SECRET may sit in the browser bundle.
 *
 * Read `'needs-proxy'` as "a server hop is mandatory" and `'frontend-safe'` as
 * "the browser may call the upstream itself". This is the flag `create-kai`
 * consults before it decides where a key goes, so getting it wrong in the
 * permissive direction writes an API key into client code. There is deliberately
 * no default and no boolean: the refinement below REJECTS an integration that
 * declares neither, because "absent" must never read as "safe".
 *
 * `'needs-proxy'` covers two cases, and the second is easy to miss:
 *   1. a secret. The route holds a key, so a static bundle cannot.
 *   2. a server-only CAPABILITY. `pi` spawns a local process; no key is involved
 *      and a browser still cannot do it.
 *
 * `'frontend-safe'` is the narrow claim: nothing secret AND no server-only
 * capability. Two integrations qualify, and both were read off their routes —
 * `ollama` fetches `localhost:11434` with no auth header at all, and `mock`
 * ships no route to reach.
 *
 * Do not infer this from the provider's name. A provider with a CORS-friendly
 * public endpoint and one that requires a proxy look identical from outside; only
 * the route says which it is. That is the same lesson `forwardsFromClient` and
 * `clientToolFormat` were each added to record.

/**
 * What this integration needs the developer to supply OUT OF BAND — beyond an
 * install and a key.
 *
 * `create-kai` groups its gateway prompt three ways: **No backend**, **Bring a
 * key**, **Bring a server or runtime**. The third group is defined by exactly
 * this question, and until now the catalog could not answer it. Every derivation
 * that reproduced the spec's split did so by accident and broke on inspection:
 *   · `category` does not separate them at all — `provider` holds `openai` and
 *     `ollama`, `framework` holds `vercel-ai-sdk` and `langgraph`.
 *   · a non-empty `routeTemplates` picks out `cloudflare`/`pi`/`pydantic-ai`,
 *     which is a fact about how a route is EXPRESSED, not about what it needs.
 *   · "declares a secret env var" puts `langgraph` and `pydantic-ai` in the key
 *     group, which is right for one and wrong for the other.
 * So it is declared, for the reason `keyExposure`, `forwardsFromClient` and
 * `clientToolFormat` are each declared: only the route knows.
 *
 * The four values, and what makes each its own case for the CLI rather than a
 * boolean it could have been:
 *
 *   · `'none'` ......... `npm install` plus (maybe) a key is the whole story.
 *     The upstream is a remote HTTPS endpoint, or the agent runs IN the route.
 *     `langgraph` is the one worth reading twice: it is in the spec's "server or
 *     runtime" group and does not belong there — its emitted route builds the
 *     graph in process (`createReactAgent` + `new ChatOpenAI(...)`), so there is
 *     no LangGraph server anywhere and its runNote asks only for a key.
 *   · `'local-server'` . a separate process must already be LISTENING before the
 *     app works. The CLI cannot create it and must say so: `ollama serve` on
 *     11434, a `mastra dev` server behind `MASTRA_URL`.
 *   · `'local-binary'` . an executable must be on PATH; the route spawns it on
 *     demand rather than talking to a port. Nothing is listening beforehand, so
 *     "start the server" is the wrong instruction — `pi` is the case.
 *   · `'language-runtime'` the emitted backend runs on a runtime the JS toolchain
 *     does not provide, and the user starts it themselves. `pydantic-ai` is a
 *     FastAPI service: `deps.pip`, `uvicorn main:app`, a second port.
 *
 * A boolean would collapse the last three, and they are three different sentences
 * to print next to a menu item. The refinement below REFUSES an integration that
 * declares nothing, for the same reason `keyExposure` does: a missing value read
 * as `'none'` is a scaffold that says "npm run dev" to someone who needs to start
 * Ollama first, and then reports as a broken kit.
