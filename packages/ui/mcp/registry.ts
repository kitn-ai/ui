/**
 * The gateway prompt's three groups, DERIVED — the thing the spec described and
 * the catalog could not answer.
 *
 * It is here, and not in the CLI, for the reason `deps` is not in the spec's
 * prose: a grouping maintained next to the menu that renders it is a second copy
 * of the catalog, and it goes stale the first time an integration lands. Adding
 * one now moves these groups by itself, because the only inputs are declared
 * fields.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE TESTS IS THE DESIGN, not an implementation detail:
 *
 *   1. `keyExposure === 'frontend-safe' && outOfBand === 'none'` -> **No
 *      backend**. Exactly `mock` today, and still derived from declared facts
 *      rather than from `id === 'mock'` or `category === 'mock'`: a second
 *      no-backend entry (a canned transcript player, say) lands here by
 *      declaring the same two. This USED to be "has no route at all", and the
 *      G-04 fix broke that derivation on purpose: mock now ships an OPTIONAL
 *      route (the same responder frames over HTTP), and a route the app runs
 *      fine without must not move its heading. What "no backend" really claims
 *      is that the browser can do the whole job — nothing secret or server-only
 *      (frontend-safe) and nothing to install or start out of band ('none') —
 *      so that pair is the derivation. `ollama` is the near-miss that keeps it
 *      honest: frontend-safe, but 'local-server' — something must be listening.
 *   2. `outOfBand !== 'none'` -> **Bring a server or runtime**, and this is
 *      checked BEFORE the key test on purpose. `pydantic-ai` needs both a python
 *      runtime and OPENAI_API_KEY; the groups are not disjoint in reality, so
 *      something has to win, and the prerequisite does — a key is useless until
 *      the service it authenticates is running. The prompt still asks for the
 *      key afterwards; only the HEADING is decided here.
 *   3. Everything else -> **Bring a key**.
 *
 * WHERE THIS DIVERGES FROM THE SPEC, ON PURPOSE. The spec's third group reads
 * "Ollama, LangGraph, Mastra, Pydantic AI, Pi". `langgraph` comes out of this
 * function in **Bring a key** instead, because its emitted route compiles the
 * graph in process and asks for nothing but `OPENAI_API_KEY` — see the comment on
 * its `outOfBand`. The spec sentence was written before the field existed and is
 * wrong about that one entry; this is the derivation, so this is the answer.
