/**
 * Tags agents invented while working from an acceptance pack, and what they
 * should have used instead. The pack's `FABRICATED.md` is rendered from this.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN AUTHORED RECORD AND NOT A LOG THE EVALUATOR APPENDS TO.
 * A row here is a claim about the tree — "the kit does not ship this tag" — and
 * the claim rots in one direction that matters: the day the kit ships
 * `kai-datagrid`, a row saying it does not exist becomes a lie told to every
 * future agent, on the one page whose whole job is telling agents what is real.
 * Living beside `invariants.ts` puts it where `fabrications.test.ts` can resolve
 * it against `derived.json` in both directions on every CI run. A JSON log
 * written by a judged run would have neither the review nor the check.
 *
 * The schema is declared here rather than in `catalog-types.ts` because this
 * record arrived a task later than that file and nothing else consumes the
 * shape; fold it in there if a second consumer appears.
 *
 * EVERY ROW COMES FROM AN OBSERVED RUN. Do not seed it with tags a model might
 * plausibly invent — a fabricated fabrication is exactly the failure the page
 * exists to prevent, and it would be indistinguishable from a real one.
