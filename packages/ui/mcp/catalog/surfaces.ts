/**
 * Spec §4's sort, as records. Criterion: a surface is product-shaped, something
 * a user could be handed, proven end-to-end by a Labs/App or deployable alone;
 * an ingredient exists only inside something else; fixtures and proofs are
 * corpus (tests), not catalog entries.
 *
 * TWO SENSES OF "CORPUS", and they are not the same thing. Here it is a `sort`:
 * this entry is a fixture or a proof, so it is test material rather than a
 * catalog entry. On a SurfaceRecipe, `corpus:` is a list of repo PATHS that
 * demonstrate the recipe. A story can be both — `split-workspace` is sorted
 * `surface` in this inventory and also appears in a recipe's `corpus:` array,
 * which is coherent (a product-shaped surface is exactly what demonstrates a
 * recipe) but reads as a contradiction if you join the two on the word. A
 * packer must key on `sort === 'corpus'` and on `recipe.corpus` separately.
 *
 * Every `title` is a real Storybook title segment under `Labs/` — the app names
 * are the `Labs/Apps` story FILENAMES, the rest are `title: 'Labs/<x>'` values
 * under src/ (note: NOT all under src/web-components/ — Settings lives in src/components/ and
 * Audio Visualizers under src/components/, so a check scoped to src/web-components/
 * alone would wrongly flag them).
 *
 * WHAT IS ENFORCED TODAY, in the present tense. Every claim below was measured
 * by mutation in both directions, not reasoned from reading the guards.
 *
 * EVERY ROW IS RESOLVED AGAINST THE TREE. `lint:catalog-drift` (required CI,
 * needs no build) requires each title to match a Labs story title or a
 * `Labs/Apps` story filename on disk. Misspell ANY row -- tier is irrelevant --
 * and CI fails by name: `Settings` -> `Settingss` gives
 * `inventory: "Settingss" matches no Labs story title or Labs/Apps story file in
 * the tree.` That closes what an earlier version of this comment called
 * "GENUINELY UNCHECKED", and the earlier text is worth remembering as a defect
 * in its own right: it survived the guard landing and went on telling every
 * maintainer that the coverage did not exist, which is how someone ends up
 * rebuilding it.
 *
 * WHAT RESOLUTION DOES NOT COVER IS DELETION, because the check runs row -> tree
 * and a deleted row asks nothing of the tree. The other direction is covered
 * unevenly, and this is the part to read before deleting anything:
 *
 *  1. `surface` rows naming a `Labs/Apps` story FILE -- deletion FAILS
 *     surfaces.test.ts, which reads those filenames off disk and requires each
 *     to have a row sorted `surface`. Covered in both directions.
 *  2. `Proofs`, `Chat Slots`, `Prompt Input Slots`, `Workspace Slots` --
 *     deletion FAILS surfaces.test.ts, which asserts those four exact titles are
 *     present and sorted `corpus`. That list is a literal copy of these four
 *     titles living inside the test; changing one means changing both.
 *  3. Every remaining row -- deletion PASSES everything. Measured: removing the
 *     `Settings` row leaves both surfaces.test.ts and lint:catalog-drift green.
 *     This is the one real gap, and the lint's own honesty item 8 states it.
 *
 * Each row's tier is decided by which test in surfaces.test.ts covers it, so
 * read that file, not this list, if they drift.

Collapse is the RAIL\'s own (collapsed / collapse() / kai-collapse-toggle) and <kai-chat> does not react to it, so a collapsed rail leaves the column at its fixed width; there is no responsive behaviour here either. Give the rail height (display:block;height:100%) and drive it through its own JS properties — being slotted changes where it renders, never how it is wired. If the COLUMN itself has to collapse, resize or respond to width, that is the <kai-workspace> layout shell (its start aside: startCollapsed / collapseBelow / drawer-below, widths via the --kai-workspace-start-* custom properties) or a layout you own',
