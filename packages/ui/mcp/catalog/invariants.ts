/**
 * Spec §5. Every one already known to break real consumers.
 *
 * The `statement` is the prose an agent applies; the `examples` are the part a
 * weak model can pattern-match, so each `wrong` is a single-line literal the
 * self-audit can grep for (enforced by invariants.test.ts, not by this comment).
 *
 * `enforcedBy` paths are REPO-relative; `lint` names a script in
 * packages/ui/package.json. `kind: 'none'` is an honest coverage gap. Where a
 * guard covers only part of a statement the record is `status: 'partial'` and
 * the statement says which half is which — an invariant that overstates its own
 * enforcement is worse than one that admits a gap, because a reader stops
 * looking.
 *
 * EXAMPLES ARE CONSUMER CODE. Every `right` form must be runnable by someone who
 * has only installed the package: no import that is not in the `exports` map.
 * The kit's own guards (isSafeUrl, isRenderableLink) live in `src/primitives`,
 * which ships compiled and unexported, so they are named as repo-internal
 * guidance and never written as a consumer import.
