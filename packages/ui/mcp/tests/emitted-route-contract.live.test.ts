/**
 * EXECUTE the scaffolder's emitted BACKEND ROUTE against the host SDK it really
 * imports, with the transport stubbed. No key, no provider, no request leaves
 * the machine.
 *
 * THE DEFECT CLASS, STATED PRECISELY
 * ----------------------------------
 * This is not about models, and no network call is involved. It is: OUR
 * ENCODER'S OUTPUT IS INVALID INPUT TO THEIR SDK, rejected before any request is
 * issued. The route compiles, `verify:scaffold` is green, and every turn fails.
 *
 * The instance that earned this file, found only by driving a live model:
 *
 *   InvalidPromptError: System messages are not allowed in the prompt or
 *   messages fields. Use the instructions option instead.
 *
 * `SystemModelMessage` is still a member of `ai`'s `ModelMessage` union, so a
 * system entry in `messages` TYPECHECKS, and then `ai` v7's `standardizePrompt`
 * refuses it. Fixed in #227 by hoisting system turns into `instructions`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS THE REQUEST SIDE
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * Every covered route is driven with a genuine thread — `toOpenAIMessages` from
 * the kit's own encoder, with a system message prepended exactly as an app does
 * (see `examples/internal/openrouter-spike/src/hooks/useSpikeChat.ts`, which is
 * the app that hit the live failure) — and then asked ONE structural question:
 *
 *   DID THE ROUTE REACH ITS TRANSPORT AT ALL, CARRYING THE THREAD?
 *
 * That is the question the defect class answers "no" to, for every member of it,
 * whatever the SDK and whatever the error. It is deliberately NOT "did the
 * response parse": faking each SDK's own response protocol well enough to assert
 * on it would mean maintaining a fake of the thing under test, and the response
 * half already has real coverage (`src/wire/*-fixtures.test.ts` replay recorded
 * provider bytes; the spike replays recorded live streams).
 *
 * THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS IS "A REQUEST WAS ISSUED", NOT "NO ERROR FRAME",
 * and that is a measurement rather than a preference. Driven against the route
 * as it shipped before #227, `ai` v7 produces:
 *
 *   · `result.textStream` — 0 deltas, NO throw, NO error part. The route emits
 *     `data: [DONE]` and nothing else. A silent empty stream: blank bubble,
 *     empty console.
 *   · `result.fullStream` — parts `['start', 'error']`, NO throw. The route's
 *     `case 'error'` turns that into an in-band error frame.
 *
 * The shipped pre-#227 route used `textStream`. So a guard that looked for an
 * error frame would have gone GREEN on the broken route that was actually in
 * main. Only "a request was issued" catches it. See the commit that added this
 * file for the watched reproduction.
 *
 * COVERAGE IS DERIVED, AND EMPTY IS A HARD FAILURE
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The cells come from the catalog at run time, never from a list written here,
 * and `NOT_EXECUTABLE` has to name every integration that produces none — with a
 * reason that is CHECKED, not merely stated. A new integration therefore lands
 * in one of the two sets or this file goes red, and a harness that covers
 * nothing fails instead of passing. This repo has a CI step that exists solely
 * because a runner exits 0 on zero matches; the same mistake is available here.
 *
 * `outOfBand` DOES NOT DECIDE REACHABILITY, which is worth saying because it
 * looks as though it should. It describes what a DEVELOPER has to start, not
 * what this file needs. `mastra` and `ollama` are both `local-server` and both
 * covered: their routes reach that server over HTTP, so the stub stands in for
 * it exactly. `pi` is `local-binary` and is not covered: its transport is a
 * spawned child process over stdin, which no fetch stub can stand in for.
 *
 * THE LIMIT OF THE STUB, stated rather than left implicit: it replaces
 * `globalThis.fetch`, which is what all four SDKs here measurably use. An SDK
 * that switched to `node:http` would not be recorded, so its cell would fail the
 * "issued a request" assertion — loudly, but only after one request had already
 * gone out. That is how the escape described below was found, and it is the
 * reason this file has no path that could reach a provider WITH a real key: the
 * environment it sets is fake, and the required CI job has no secrets to leak
 * into it.
