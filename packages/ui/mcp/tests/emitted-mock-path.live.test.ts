/**
 * RUN the scaffolder's emitted ZERO-CONFIG path. Do not read it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `integration: 'mock'` is the first thing anyone sees: it is what `create-kai`
 * produces when you press Enter through every prompt, with no key and no backend.
 * If it does not stream, the tool is dead on arrival — and nothing above this
 * layer can tell whether it streams:
 *
 *   · `scaffold.test.ts` asserts the WORDING of string literals.
 *   · `verify:scaffold` COMPILES the output under eight consumer tsconfigs.
 *
 * Both were green for the whole life of the previous hand-rolled mock, which
 * replaced `parts` wholesale and silently deleted any reasoning/tool part already
 * on the message. So this writes the emitted `src/main.ts` to a real module,
 * EXECUTES it against a mounted `<kai-chat>`, and asserts a reply reaches the
 * shadow DOM.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS THAT IS NOT "DOES TEXT APPEAR"
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Two things, and they are the reason the file is worth its seconds:
 *
 *   1. NO PROVIDER IS CONTACTED. `fetch` is replaced by a spy that FAILS the test
 *      if it is called at all. A mock that quietly acquired a network call is the
 *      exact bug this repo already shipped once (a fabricated tool call POSTed
 *      ahead of the user's own message), and the only honest way to assert the
 *      absence of a request is to make one throw.
 *   2. IT GOES THROUGH THE KIT'S PARSER. The emitted module is asserted to hand
 *      `mockResponse(value)` to `readOpenAIStream` — the same call the real
 *      backend path makes — rather than folding tokens itself. That is what makes
 *      the zero-config default a live regression test of the SSE reader instead
 *      of a code path that shares nothing with production.
 *
 * The `html` target is used for the same reason `emitted-card-path.live.test.ts`
 * uses it: its emitted logic is a plain TS module over a `KaiChatElement`, with no
 * framework runtime in the way, and it shares `realStreamBody` with the other
 * seven — so the streaming half is exercised for all of them.
