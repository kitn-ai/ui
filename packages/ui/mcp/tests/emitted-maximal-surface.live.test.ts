/**
 * RUN the scaffolder's MAXIMAL surface — the composed markup, not a bare <kai-chat>.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The other two guards in this project execute the emitted `src/main.ts`, but both
 * mount it against a hand-written `<kai-chat id="chat">`. That is fine for what
 * they check (the card round trip, the zero-config stream) and it means the other
 * half of the emit — `componentTags`, the markup — is executed by nothing. So the
 * one cell where the workspace split, the tool loop and the card registry all land
 * in the same file is COMPILED and never RUN.
 *
 * That gap has already cost a real bug. When `every-capability` was added to the
 * verify:scaffold axis it failed to compile in 33 cells, because every renderer's
 * workspace branch emitted the split and RETURNED, dropping standalone companions
 * on the floor. React, Next and TanStack failed TS6133 on the now-unused import —
 * but vue, svelte, angular and html COMPILED CLEAN AND RENDERED NOTHING. Four of
 * seven frameworks were caught by the compiler; the silent three needed execution,
 * and there was none. `create-kai` now calls `renderSurface` directly and its whole
 * promise is that a scaffold runs on first `npm run dev`, so the maximal surface is
 * both the most likely to be wrong and the most expensive to get wrong.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM `verify:scaffold`
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * `verify:scaffold` compiles this exact cell under eight consumer tsconfigs.
 * Compilation cannot see a dropped tag: markup lives in a string literal, so a
 * surface that emits the split and forgets its companions is type-correct. Nor can
 * `scaffold.test.ts`, which asserts the WORDING of those literals. The only layer
 * that can tell a composed surface from a plausible-looking one is the one that
 * puts it in a document and looks at what upgraded.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY EACH IS EXECUTION RATHER THAN TEXT
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Every DOM claim below is scoped to something the LIVE component produces, never
 * to a string that was already in the emitted markup:
 *
 *   · `slot="p0"` / `slot="p1"` are NOT in the emit. `<kai-resizable>` writes them
 *     onto its light-DOM children when it renders, so asserting the chat pane is
 *     p0 and the artifact pane is p1 proves the split composed — an innerHTML that
 *     never upgraded carries neither.
 *   · `data-min-size` / `data-default-size-pct` on the shadow panels are PARSED
 *     from the emitted `min="240px"` / `size="40%"` attributes. They prove the
 *     emitted numbers reached the layout, not merely the document.
 *   · The `kai-sources` assertion reads the ANCHORS its shadow root renders from
 *     the `sampleSources` array the emitted module assigns. That is the companion
 *     check with teeth: it needs the tag to have survived `componentTags` AND the
 *     emitted module to have found `#sources` and populated it.
 *
 * That last one is the one that goes red for the historical bug, and it goes red
 * twice over: with companions dropped, `document.getElementById('sources')` is
 * null, so the emitted `sourcesEl.sources = sampleSources` throws inside `init()`
 * BEFORE `chat.addEventListener('kai-submit')` is reached — the surface loses its
 * sources AND stops responding to input at all. Watched failing; see the commit.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED IN THE MARKUP STRING. There is no
 * `expect(markup).toContain('kai-sources')` guard. It would be the cheaper check
 * and it would fail FIRST, masking the runtime failure and quietly turning this
 * file back into the wording test it exists to replace.
 *
 * THE SURFACE IS DERIVED, NOT RESTATED. `listSurfaceProbes()` owns the axis that
 * `verify:scaffold` compiles; the maximal cell is taken from it by size and then
 * checked to cover every capability group. Hard-coding the seven tags would let
 * the axis grow a capability that this file silently stopped composing.
