/**
 * The four blocks assertions whose inputs live in THIS package: the real
 * integration catalog, the real web-component-nonscalar map, this package's version,
 * and the BUILT artifacts under dist/blocks/ plus the generated driver page.
 *
 * They were part of mcp/tests/blocks-registry.test.ts before that suite moved
 * to @kitn.ai/blocks, and they stay here rather than moving with it because the
 * blocks package depends on nothing and must not grow a build-order dependency
 * on the kit. Splitting on "what are the inputs" rather than "what is the
 * subject" is what keeps both halves honest.
 *
 * They are in the `unit` project on purpose: verify:blocks covers the same
 * ground but needs a real browser and a full build, so this is what catches a
 * stale build in the fast suite.
