/**
 * RUN the scaffolder's emitted CONVERSATION RAIL. Do not read it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The rail's wiring shipped with the thread swap correct and the ROW inert. Every
 * row was written once, at creation, and never touched again: after a full turn
 * the sidebar still read "New chat / 0 messages / just now" while the thread beside
 * it held two messages. A consumer pasting that gets a rail that looks broken.
 *
 * Nothing above this layer could see it. `scaffold.test.ts` asserts the WORDING of
 * string literals and the wording was fine — the emit says it wires the rail, and
 * it does wire the half it claims. `verify:scaffold` COMPILES the output under
 * eight consumer tsconfigs, and a row that is never updated type-checks perfectly.
 * The defect was found by running the emitted app in a browser and reading the
 * sidebar, which is what this file automates.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS THAT A STRING ASSERTION CANNOT
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The kit's `reactivity-two-halves` invariant, which the emitted code is itself a
 * worked example of. `<kai-conversations>` renders rows through a reference-keyed
 * `<For>`, so updating one needs BOTH a new array reference (what NOTIFIES) and a
 * new object for the row that changed (what makes it VISIBLE). The two halves fail
 * differently and both fail SILENTLY:
 *
 *   · same array back      -> nothing notifies, nothing repaints.
 *   · row mutated in place -> the list notifies and the ROW still does not repaint,
 *                             because `<For>` captured it as a value.
 *
 * The second one is the trap, and it is invisible to every check that reads the
 * emitted text or the `conversations` property: the property holds the right
 * numbers and the screen holds the old ones. So the load-bearing assertions here
 * are read off the rail's own SHADOW DOM — the count and the title as rendered —
 * never off the array that was assigned to it. `src/components/reactivity-contract/reactivity-contract.test.tsx`
 * pins the same invariant for the component; this pins that the emitted code obeys it.
 *
 * WHY `mock`. The turn has to complete for the row to advance, and the mock
 * integration is the one path that completes without a provider or a route — the
 * same reason `emitted-mock-path.live.test.ts` uses it. `fetch` is a thrower here
 * for the same reason it is there: the only honest way to assert no request.
