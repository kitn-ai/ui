 * cell count in `verify:scaffold` by itself.

 * disclosure is not a surface anyone asks for, `kai-artifact` /
 * `kai-resizable` are one because `isArtifactSplit` in scaffold.ts only fires when BOTH are present
 * — split them and the renderer emits a bare artifact with no pane to put it in
 * — and `kai-file-upload` / `kai-attachments` are one because `hasAttachments`
 * fires the same way, for the same kind of reason.

 * distinct components lists (`support-widget` repeats `drop-in-chat`'s, and the
 * matrix holds `placement` at one value, so that pair compiled the same types
 * twice). More importantly they cover no combination at all — every preset is
 * exactly one capability — so the surfaces the multi-select makes reachable,
 * which is most of them, had nothing compiling them.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE POWER SET. 2^groups x integrations x frameworks is thousands of
 * cells to exercise no new branch. The renderers compose capabilities
 * INDEPENDENTLY: each companion tag is emitted on its own terms, and the
 * multi-component predicates (`isArtifactSplit`, `isWorkspaceBlock`) each read
 * components from within a single group. So
 * "every capability alone" reaches every branch, and "all capabilities together"
 * makes every PAIR of capabilities co-occur, which is what proves they compose.
 *
 * THE LIMIT, STATED: a defect needing exactly two capabilities and masked by a
 * third would survive this. That is a real gap and the honest reason it is
 * accepted is cost, not safety — no such branch exists in the renderers today,
 * and `assertSurfacesAreDistinct` fails if the axis ever degenerates so that this
 * reasoning is quietly checking less than it claims.
