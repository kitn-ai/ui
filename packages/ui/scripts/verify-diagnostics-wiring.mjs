// Does the diagnostic event stream actually reach a subscriber IN THE SHIPPED
// PACKAGE? Not "do the types line up", not "does the module import cleanly" --
// does an event emitted by a real read arrive at someone who subscribed.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `./diagnostics` shipped completely inert and every gate was
// green over it. `verify:ssr` proved the subpath imports; `verify:dts:consumer`
// proved its types resolve; the unit suite proved the SOURCE module works. None
// of them executes a subscription against the built files, and the built files
// are where the defect lived:
//
//   · `dist/wire.js` and `dist/diagnostics.js` are separate rollup builds that
//     each inlined their own copy of `src/wire/diagnostics.ts`, so the two did
//     not share the subscriber list at all; and
//   · nothing in the diagnostics bundle CALLS the emitter, so rollup decided the
//     subscriber array was write-only and deleted it, reducing that bundle's
//     `subscribeWireDiagnostics` to `function f(){ let t=1; return () => {...} }`
//     -- it registered nothing and returned a no-op.
//
// So a consumer could install the devtools hook and read a stream and have the
// two be completely disconnected, with no error anywhere.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, and check 2 is the one that generalises:
//   1. A subscriber registered through `./diagnostics` receives events from a
//      read performed through `./wire`. That is the exact shipped defect.
//   2. TWO DISTINCT INSTANCES of the same module share state. This is the whole
//      duplication CLASS, not just our build config: a consumer who bundles the
//      kit and also loads the web-components bundle from a CDN duplicates the module
//      identically, and no amount of shared-chunk configuration on our side
//      prevents it. Node gives us the same situation honestly by loading one
//      file twice under different specifiers.
//   3. Stream ids minted by those two instances do not collide. The counter has
//      to live in the shared state too -- two copies each starting at `wire-1`
//      mint the same id for different streams, and that id NAMESPACES REASONING
//      PARTS, so a collision silently merges one stream's reasoning blocks into
//      another's and overwrites their verbatim `raw`.
//   4. The chain a real consumer walks, and the one the panel actually failed
//      on: the web-components bundle installs the hook, the app reads through the
//      separate `./wire` bundle, and the hook must receive those events.
//
// Needs a build (like verify:consumer): it reads dist/, deliberately, because
// the source passing tells you nothing about what was published.
