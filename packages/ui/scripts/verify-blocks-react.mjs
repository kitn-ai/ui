// verify:blocks:react -- the REACT RUNTIME cell (spec section 5.3, ruled).
//
// Compile-only is not enough for react, and the contract spike proved it with
// two defects that type-check perfectly: a prop set back to `undefined` being
// skipped rather than clearing (the block showed its conversation starters
// forever) and a literal on a self-managed prop being re-applied after every
// render (every navigation silently undone). PR B0 fixed both mechanisms;
// this is what keeps them fixed.
//
// It drives the PACKED TARBALL, not the tree: the tree is not the tarball.
// One throwaway Vite app is installed once and reused per block, because the
// install is the expensive part and the component is the cheap part.
//
// THE HOST IS A CHECKED-IN FIXTURE, AND ITS VERSIONS ARE THE RANGES A REAL
// create-vite APP DECLARES. scripts/block-driver/react-host/ is a stock
// create-vite react-ts app; the install here passes the tarball and NO
// package list, so what the cell gets is whatever that package.json's ranges
// resolve to. The resolved versions are printed on every run so a future red
// can be read against them.
//
// LAYOUT IS MEASURED HERE, and that number is the cell's: every probe a block's
// states name in `layoutProbes`, and every styleProbe, runs on the react page
// against the real packed tarball. No `react` page spec declares `skipLayout`
// any more -- each probe is a comparison among the block's OWN boxes (a row's
// height against its neighbour's, a glyph's left edge, a gap derived from the
// kit's density token) and the emitted tree imports the block's stylesheet, so
// the react document carries them. The driver still reports and names every
// probe it did NOT measure, and this cell reads those names off the run rather
// than restating them: a block that re-declares the skip prints a SKIP line
// here, so a green over a page that withheld its geometry cannot read like one
// that measured it.
