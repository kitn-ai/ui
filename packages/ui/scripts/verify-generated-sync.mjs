// Generated-artifact drift guard: the checked-in files that are DERIVED from
// src/web-components must match what their generator produces right now.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
// -------------
// fc40a10 registered a new `::part(citations)` in src/web-components/slots/slots.ts and did
// not regenerate the artifacts derived from it. Nothing went red. The `kai`
// MCP's `component_reference` and the docs site's PartTable.astro both read from
// those artifacts, so a part that existed in the SHIPPED web component was invisible
// to every tool a developer would use to discover it. That is a
// developer-experience defect, not untidy files, and it was found by a human
// noticing — which does not scale.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
// ---------------
// Runs the real generator (`npm run build:api` — the same command this guard
// tells you to run, so the fix and the check can never diverge) and fails if any
// derived file in the tree differs from what came out.
//
// THE TRAP THIS GUARD IS BUILT AROUND (documented in CLAUDE.md)
// -------------------------------------------------------------
//   `nx build ui` is not a dependable way to regenerate these. It runs them
//   via postbuild, but the generators write side-effects into the SOURCE tree
//   and the NX cache does not restore those, so on a cache HIT the target
//   prints "Successfully ran target build" and leaves the tree stale — a
//   cached build is indistinguishable from a successful one. A guard layered
//   on `nx build ui` could therefore pass on a stale tree. This guard invokes
//   build:api directly and never goes through NX, so no cache state can
//   affect its result.
//   (Measured in this repo: three consecutive `nx build ui` runs all MISSED
//   the cache and did regenerate — the target's own source-tree side effects
//   dirty its input hash, so it re-runs. The guard does not depend on that
//   staying true, which is the point.)
//
// WHY IT CANNOT PASS VACUOUSLY
// ----------------------------
// A diff-based guard has an obvious hole: if the generator silently stops
// writing a file — deleted, renamed, an output dropped, an early `return` — then
// "nothing changed" reads as "in sync" and the check passes forever while
// covering nothing. So before running the generator, every derived file is
// overwritten with a single-use random SENTINEL. Afterwards the sentinel MUST be
// gone from every one of them. That is a live, per-run proof that this specific
// run genuinely rewrote this specific file. Delete the generator, drop one of
// its outputs, or have it no-op, and this guard goes red rather than green.
// Emptiness is covered too: a generator that writes zero bytes clears the
// sentinel but fails the structural sanity check below.
//
// WHAT THE SENTINEL DOES NOT COVER, AND WHY `--self-test` EXISTS
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// An audit put this precisely: the sentinel proves the generators RE-RAN, and
// nothing proved the COMPARATOR still notices drift. Those are different halves.
// The sentinel could keep working perfectly while the `a.equals(b)` half was
// deleted, inverted, or fed the wrong buffers, and every run would stay green on
// a tree with stale artifacts — which is the exact defect fc40a10 shipped and
// this guard was written to catch. So `--self-test` builds throwaway repos with
// a stub generator, lets the sentinel clear NORMALLY, and plants a DRIFTED
// artifact: the comparator alone has to produce the red.
//
//   node scripts/verify-generated-sync.mjs                        # the real tree
//   node scripts/verify-generated-sync.mjs --self-test            # prove it still detects
//   node scripts/verify-generated-sync.mjs --fixture-config <f>   # any synthesized repo
//
// It also pins the promise this guard makes about YOUR tree: it rewrites these
// files for the duration of a run, and must restore every one of them, pass or
// fail. A self-test case asserts the bytes are back afterwards.
//
// The guard is read-only with respect to your tree: every file is snapshotted up
// front and restored on the way out, pass or fail, including on Ctrl-C. It never
// silently fixes the drift it is reporting.
//
// CAVEAT: read-only is the NET effect, not the intermediate state — the sentinel
// pass genuinely rewrites these files for the duration of the run. Do not run
// this concurrently with the test suite, Storybook or a dev server in the same
// worktree; they read the same files. CI runs it as its own sequential step.
// (This is also why the self-test synthesizes its own repos rather than planting
// drift in yours, and why the wiring test never runs the real configuration.)
//
// No network, no build required — build:api writes dist/custom-elements.json
// itself before the downstream generators read it.

//
// web-component-manifest.json is in `build:api` for THIS guard's sake and it is worth
// knowing why, because it looks redundant: `build:web-components` already runs the
// same generator, ahead of the web-components vite build that needs the entry points.
// But this guard only ever runs `build:api`, so while the manifest was reachable
// only through `build:web-components` it could not be covered here at all — the
// sentinel would survive the run and the guard would fail on every clean tree.
// Adding it to the list without adding it to `build:api` produces a check that
// is red always, which is the same as no check. The generator is a pure scan of
// register-impl.ts and src/web-components/*.ts[x] — no build, no network, idempotent —
// so running it in both places costs milliseconds and cannot diverge.
//
// `probe` says how to plant the sentinel:
//   'overwrite' — the generator rewrites the whole file, so clobber it.
//   'in-block'  — docs/web-components.md is NOT fully generated. The generator
