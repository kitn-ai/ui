// Every authored claim in the catalog must resolve against the derived layer
// and the tree, or the build fails. This is the structural answer to how the
// roster died: hand-written prose about a tree that kept moving.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH — every item below was MEASURED by mutating the real
// catalog and watching this lint stay green, not reasoned about. Read it before
// trusting a green run to mean more than it does. The shape they share: this
// lint resolves NAMES, and a name resolving says nothing about whether the
// claim attached to it is true.
//
//  1. AN OVERSTATED `enforcedBy`. This lint resolves that a cited path EXISTS.
//     It can never judge whether the citation is PROPORTIONATE to what the
//     cited thing actually does — whether that test covers the whole statement
//     or one clause of it. This is not hypothetical: four of the seven seed
//     invariants overstated their own enforcement on first authoring, and every
//     one was caught by human review, none by any check. Measured twice here.
//     Repoint `reactivity-two-halves` at scenarios.test.ts — a real file that
//     tests something else entirely — and this lint passes. Upgrade
//     `kit-parses-consumer-fetches` from `status: 'partial'` to `'enforced'`
//     while its `enforcedBy` covers only half the statement, and this lint
//     passes. `status: 'partial'` exists to record the honest version and
//     nothing mechanical can verify it was chosen; only a reader can.
//  2. SEMANTICALLY WRONG BUT RESOLVABLE WIRING. An edge naming a real event on
//     a real element and a real property on another real element passes here
//     even when the pair is nonsense. Measured: rewiring `kai-new-chat` onto
//     `kai-chat.placeholder` resolves clean. Only the executed probes in
//     surfaces.test.ts (which drive every edge against the registered elements
//     in jsdom) catch that, and only for edges someone wrote a probe for.
//  3. A VARIANT DROPPED FROM ONE part-consumption record while ANOTHER record
//     still lists it. The union-coverage check unions across all records, so it
//     answers "does some record account for this variant", never "does THIS
//     element still claim it". Measured: deleting 'file' from `kai-chat`'s
//     `consumes` passes green, because `kai-message` also lists it; deleting it
//     from both fires, and so does adding a variant to `derived.partVariants`.
//     That is the check working as specified — the union gaining a variant is
//     what it is for — but do not read a green as per-element coverage. Which
//     elements a variant is claimed by is an EDITORIAL claim nothing in the tree
//     derives (see the registered-copy note in surfaces.ts), so it is measured
//     by the acceptance deck, not here, and an assertion that merely looked like
//     it covered that would be worse than the honest gap.
//  4. AN INVENTORY ROW POINTING AT THE WRONG REAL STORY. Titles resolve as a
//     SET. Measured: swap the `Menu` and `Settings` rows' titles so each row's
//     `note` now describes the other, and the run is clean. Set membership is
//     all the tree affords — nothing derives which note belongs to which title.
//  5. EDITORIAL FIELDS WITH NO DERIVATION BEHIND THEM: `sort`, `archetypes`,
//     `intent`, `note`. Measured: flipping `workspace-chat` from `full-screen`
//     to `inline`, and replacing its `intent` with prose describing a different
//     product entirely, both pass. surfaces.test.ts pins `sort` for the app rows
//     and the four fixture rows; every other editorial field is reviewed prose.
//  6. A WRONG `derived.json`. This lint trusts it as the tree's reading, and
//     will happily resolve authored claims against a fiction. Measured: add a
//     fabricated `kai-datagrid` element to derived.json, then list it as a
//     recipe ingredient, and the run is clean — the very fabrication the
//     ingredient check exists to stop, waved through because the fiction was
//     planted upstream. derived.json's fidelity is Task 3's generator and
//     `verify:generated-sync`; this lint is downstream of both and cannot
//     substitute for either.
//  7. A RECIPE THAT NOBODY CAN BUILD FROM. Every field can resolve while the
//     recipe as a whole is unbuildable; that is what the acceptance deck (S1-S7)
//     measures, and it is why the deck was written before the catalog.
//  8. THE TREE -> ROW DIRECTION, for everything except the nine Labs/Apps files.
//     By design, but know the shape of it. Measured, all green: adding a new
//     `Labs/Brand New Thing` story with no inventory row passes; DELETING a
//     tier-3 row passes; and the inventory can shrink from 26 rows to one and
//     still pass, because the anti-vacuity floors are `length === 0` and a
//     single survivor satisfies them. Only `surfaces.test.ts` test 2 requires a
//     row to exist, and only for the Apps files.
//  9. A GROUP ROW OUTLIVING ALMOST ALL OF ITS STORIES. `Foundations` resolves
//     through a SYNTHESIZED group name: any `Labs/Foundations/<x>` title
//     registers the bare `Foundations`. Measured: deleting all twelve
//     Foundations stories does fire, but deleting ELEVEN of the twelve is
//     green. The row proves the group exists, never that it still holds what
//     its `note` lists.
// 10. DUPLICATE INVENTORY TITLES, including contradictory ones. Measured: a
//     second `Menu` row sorted `corpus` beside the real one sorted `ingredient`
//     passes, reporting 27 rows clean. Titles are resolved as set membership,
//     so a duplicate resolves exactly as well as the original.
// 11. THE GAP COUNT SILENTLY GOING TO ZERO. Gaps are reported, never asserted.
//     Measured: giving all three `kind:'none'` invariants a real `lint:` script
//     takes the run from 3 gaps to 0 and stays green — correct if the guards
//     were truly written, and indistinguishable from someone deleting the
//     honest record of what is unenforced. The `status`/`kind` agreement that
//     would catch the dishonest version lives in invariants.test.ts.
// 12. RESIDUAL AFTER THE PARSER FIX: an INTERPOLATED title is invisible.
//     `title: 'Labs/X'`, `"Labs/X"` and `` `Labs/X` `` are all read; a
//     substituted template `` title: `Labs/${name}` `` yields nothing —
//     measured, returns []. A story titled that way would look unregistered and
//     its inventory row would fail, which is the loud direction, but the row
//     could not be made to pass without rewriting the story.
//
//     ⚠ THIS ITEM PREVIOUSLY SAID SOMETHING FALSE, and how it was false is the
//     more useful record. It claimed the hand-rolled comment stripper's errors
//     "blank MORE than intended, which fails loudly" and that it "cannot invent
//     a title". Both halves were wrong. JSX text containing an unbalanced
//     apostrophe (`Don't have an account?`) put the scanner into single-quote
//     state and it never left, so every later comment SURVIVED stripping: it
//     blanked LESS than intended, and it DID invent a title. Live in three
//     files at the time. The caveat was reasoned, not measured — which is the
//     same defect as an overstated `enforcedBy` (item 1), committed in the
//     block that exists to prevent it.
// 13. RESIDUAL AFTER THE PATH FIX: `isFile` proves a cited path is a file, not
//     that the file contains a test, still less a test of THIS invariant — see
//     item 1, which is the same limit in its most consequential form.
// 14. A CI STEP NEUTERED INSIDE THE `run:` LINE. The guard-wiring test rejects
//     `continue-on-error` and a false `if:`, but appending `|| true` to the
//     shell command leaves it GREEN — measured, 13 passed. The step still runs
//     and its failure is still discarded. This is a class the repo's other
//     wiring guards share, not specific to this one, and it wants a single
//     workflow-wide check rather than a fourth copy of the same assertion here.
// 15. A BUG BOTH COPIES SHARE — CURRENT STATE, not history. The equivalence
//     guard on `readLabsTitles` catches DIVERGENCE between the .mjs and .ts
//     implementations and is structurally blind to a mistake they agree on. It
//     has now been green through TWO real defects that were present in both
//     copies at once: the hand-rolled stripper's apostrophe bug, and the
//     any-position `title:` read that let `{ args: { title: 'Labs/Apps' } }`
//     conjure a phantom app. Every limitation from item 16 down is likewise
//     shared by both copies and invisible to that guard. It is the backstop
//     against drift, never the reason to trust either side.
// 16. A STORY FILE THAT DOES NOT PARSE NEVER THROWS. `ts.createSourceFile`
//     error-recovers and this lint discards `parseDiagnostics` entirely.
//     Measured: a badly broken file returns `[]`, and a file broken AFTER the
//     meta returns the title anyway. A file whose meta stops parsing therefore
//     looks like a file with no registration — silently. The only backstop is
//     the `zero Labs titles` floor, which needs EVERY file to go dark before it
//     fires, so one corrupted story is invisible HERE. What actually contains it
//     is `typecheck`: a story file that does not parse fails tsc at exit 2 in
//     the required CI job, so a corrupted story cannot reach main while this
//     lint stays quiet about it. Reading `parseDiagnostics` would make the lint
//     self-sufficient and is deliberately not done — adjudicated as
//     gold-plating over a backstop that already exists.
// 17. HISTORICAL, fixed: `.stories.ts` used to be parsed as TSX. `ScriptKind`
//     is now chosen by extension, so this is recorded rather than live. What it
//     was: every file was parsed as TSX regardless of extension, and TSX admits
//     neither an angle-bracket cast nor a bare generic arrow. Measured on a
//     `.stories.ts` fixture, both `const n = <number>x;` AND `const f =
//     <T>(x: T) => x;` above the meta swallowed the title (`[]`), while the TSX
//     workarounds `<T,>` and `<T extends unknown>` parsed fine — which is the
//     wrong way round for safety, because the workarounds are what people learn
//     AFTER being bitten and the bare generic is what they write first. It was
//     fixed rather than documented because `typecheck` does NOT contain it: tsc
//     reads a `.ts` as TS, accepts both spellings and stays green, so the lint
//     would have silently dropped a registration from a file CI called fine.
//     No `.stories.ts` exists today; `storyExtensions()` admits them because the
//     Storybook glob does, so nothing had to be decided for it to go live.
// 18. `readWireExports` HAS BOTH FAILURE DIRECTIONS, and it is the one function
//     here rewritten without being documented until now. Measured:
//     `export * from './x'` yields `[]` and `export const r = makeReader()`
//     yields `[]` — both FALSE REDs, a real exported reader reported missing
//     (loud, and wrong). `export namespace N { export function r(){} }` yields
//     `['r']` — a FALSE ACCEPT, since `r` is not importable at the module's top
//     level. The wire module uses none of these shapes today.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED HERE: whether a wiring pair means anything (item 2).
// This lint resolves names and genuinely cannot judge semantics; the executed
// probes in surfaces.test.ts drive every edge against the real elements, and
// its `every wiring edge in every recipe has been driven above` completeness
// test is what stops an edge being added without one. An assertion here would
// look like coverage and add none.
//
// ★ THE ONE TO STATE PLAINLY: THIS LINT'S GROUND TRUTH IS `derived.json`. It
// resolves authored claims against that file, not against the tree the file
// describes. A wrong derived layer therefore yields a confidently green lint
// (item 6). What actually covers the authored layer is the COMPOSITION of
// `verify:generated` — which keeps derived.json faithful to the tree — and this
// lint, which keeps the prose faithful to derived.json. NEITHER ALONE IS
// SUFFICIENT, and a green from this script has never meant more than one half.
//
// What it DOES catch incidentally, worth knowing: a catalog file that no longer
// parses fails the esbuild step loudly rather than being skipped, because the
// authored records are loaded through their VALIDATED accessors — so a record
// violating its own zod schema is a hard failure here too, not a silent pass.
// That is also why the schema's own `.min(1)` on `wiring` fires BEFORE this
// script's readable "zero wiring edges" message on the real catalog; the
// message is reachable when check() is driven directly, as the self-test does.

  //              registered prefix
  //   admitted = everything else, including prose and unrecognised prefixes
  //              whose first word is not a stem
  //
  // FREE PROSE IS A LEGITIMATE FORM — 'composition validity', 'wiring topology'
  // — which is why `the honesty bound: refuse what is not composable…` passes.
  // Widening the stem list is how a new structured prefix gets covered; nothing
  // here detects one nobody thought to add. The zero-refs floor is the second
