// THE PACK: what an agent is handed INSTEAD of this kit's source.
//
// Packs one acceptance scenario into a directory carrying the whole catalog --
// the derived ingredient layer, the invariants, the surface recipes, the
// delivery story, the scenario prompt -- and NO kit source. Spec §6: whatever
// the agent then cannot build names exactly what the catalog is missing.
//
//   node scripts/acceptance-pack.mjs --list
//   node scripts/acceptance-pack.mjs --scenario S1 --out <dir>
//   node scripts/acceptance-pack.mjs --floor          # the floor stage alone
//   node scripts/acceptance-pack.mjs --self-test      # watch the floor detect
//
// WHY MARKDOWN AND NOT ONE catalog.json
// -------------------------------------
// A single ~100KB JSON blob is tolerable for a large model and actively wrong
// for a small one -- and small models are the primary measurement instrument
// here, because a strong model supplies a missing contract from its own priors
// and so MASKS the deficiency this deck exists to find. So the pack is an INDEX
// plus one page per web component: the agent reads the index and opens only what it
// needs. `derived.json` stays the machine artifact and the drift lint's input;
// `catalog.json` is still written, for programmatic consumers, but it is not
// what the agent reads.
//
// TWO DIRECTORIES, AND THE SPLIT IS STRUCTURAL
// --------------------------------------------
//   <out>/agent/   everything the agent under test may read
//   <out>/judge/   the evaluator's material: catalog.json, the judge checklist,
//                  the floor report, `enforcedBy` pointers and recipe `corpus`
//                  paths
// `enforcedBy` and `corpus` name files inside this repo that the agent is not
// given, and a scoring checklist in the agent's own directory is an answer key.
// A sentence asking the agent not to look is not a boundary; a directory it is
// never handed is. The runner hands over `<out>/agent/` and keeps `<out>/judge/`.
//
// EVERYTHING IS RENDERED BEFORE ANYTHING IS WRITTEN, so the cross-checks below
// -- scoring-line redaction, import specifiers resolving against the exports
// map, the floor, artifact agreement, needle soundness -- can refuse to produce
// a pack rather than produce one and then complain about it.

Kit version: \`${kitVersion}\`. Every fact in this pack was read out of that
release. There is no other documentation and no kit source: this pack is
everything.

## Read in this order

1. **PROMPT.md** — the task.
2. **DELIVERY.md** — how to install, load and register the kit. Read this before
   writing any import or script tag; the specifiers are not guessable.
3. **WEB-COMPONENTS.md** — the index of all ${derived.webComponents.length} web components, one line each. **Open only the
   web-component pages you actually need** (\`web-components/<tag>.md\`). There are
   ${webComponentPageCount} of them and reading them all is a waste of your context.
4. **SHARED-PROPS.md** — the props every web component has. They are listed once here
   and NOT repeated on the ${webComponentPageCount} web-component pages.
5. **INVARIANTS.md** — the rules that break real consumers. Each carries a
   wrong/right code pair. Apply these; they are not style advice.
6. **RECIPES.md** — proven compositions, with the host wiring written out.
7. **PARTS.md**, **INTEGRATIONS.md**, **THEME.md**, **INVENTORY.md** — reference,
   open as needed.
8. **SELF-AUDIT.md** — run this over your own output **before you deliver**.
9. **FABRICATED.md** — components other agents have invented that do not exist.

## These lists are EXHAUSTIVE

This is the part that matters most, so it is repeated on each list page:

- **WEB-COMPONENTS.md is every web component this kit defines** — all
  ${derived.webComponents.length} of them. If a tag is not in that list, **it does not
  exist**. There is no larger catalog elsewhere.
- **PARTS.md is every \`MessagePart\` variant the wire can represent** —
  ${derived.partVariants.length} of them. A part with any other \`type\` cannot be
  produced, parsed or rendered.
- **DELIVERY.md is every entry point the package publishes.** An import
  specifier that is not on that page does not resolve.
- The props, events, methods, slots and CSS parts on a web-component page are that
  web component's complete API. There are no undocumented ones.

**So if this task needs something that is not here, say so and stop.** Inventing
a plausible \`<kai-…>\` tag, prop, event or import path is the single worst
outcome: it compiles in the reader's head, renders nothing in a browser, and
costs more to diagnose than an honest refusal. Naming what is missing is a
correct and useful answer.

## The shape of this kit, in four sentences

Web components prefixed \`kai-\`, Shadow DOM, framework-agnostic. Arrays,
objects and functions go on the web component as **JS properties**; only scalars work
as attributes. Events are **non-bubbling \`kai-*\` CustomEvents** — listen on the
web component that dispatches them. There is no store: the **host** wires web component A's
event to web component B's property.

  return `# Delivery — installing, loading and registering

Nothing in this kit works until the web components are **registered**. Registration is
a side effect of importing an entry point; there is no \`init()\` to call.

## Install (bundler / npm)

${fence('npm install @kitn.ai/ui', 'bash')}

SolidJS consumers also need the peer dependency \`solid-js\`. Everyone else needs
nothing further — the built bundle ships in the package, so there is nothing to
compile.

## Entry points

**This table is the complete published surface.** An import specifier that is
not on it does not resolve, whatever it looks like.

| specifier | what it is |
| --- | --- |
${rows}

## Registering the web components

Three ways, all client-side:

${fence(
  [
    "import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components';        // registers every web component — the simple default",
    "import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components/chat';   // one web component; the bundler drops the rest",
    "import '@kitn.ai/ui/autoloader';      // loads each web component on demand as its tag appears",
  ].join('\n'),
  'js',
)}

Registration is **asynchronous** (it is gated behind a browser check so the
module is inert during SSR), so a property set immediately after the import can
land before the element upgrades and be lost. Wait for the registry:

${fence("await customElements.whenDefined('kai-chat');\nchat.messages = messages;", 'js')}

\`webComponentsReady\` from \`@kitn.ai/ui/web-components\` is a promise that resolves once
every web component is registered — await that instead if you are setting properties
on several web components at once. See \`upgrade-race\` in INVARIANTS.md.

## No build step: a script tag

The web-components bundle is a self-contained **ES module**, so it loads over
\`<script type="module">\` with no bundler and no install:

${fence(
  `<script type="module">
  import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@kitn.ai/ui@${kitVersion}/${webComponentsTarget}';
  // …or unpkg: import 'https://unpkg.com/@kitn.ai/ui@${kitVersion}/${webComponentsTarget}';

  await customElements.whenDefined('kai-chat');
  const chat = document.querySelector('kai-chat');
  chat.messages = [{ id: '1', role: 'assistant', parts: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hi' }] }];
</script>

<kai-chat></kai-chat>`,
  'html',
)}

**Pin the exact version, as above.** An unpinned CDN URL tracks the latest
release, and a CDN fetch — unlike \`npm install\` — warns you about nothing when
the version it serves has been deprecated. \`${kitVersion}\` is the version this
pack was generated from.

To override design tokens on a no-build page, add the stylesheet:

${fence(`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@kitn.ai/ui@${kitVersion}/${themeTarget}">`, 'html')}

## React

${fence("import { Chat, useKaiChat } from '@kitn.ai/ui/react';", 'tsx')}

The wrappers set array and object props as JS **properties** for you, which is
the mistake \`props-not-attributes\` describes. Everything else in this pack
still applies: the events are the same non-bubbling \`kai-*\` events, and the
reactivity rule is unchanged.

## Vue, Svelte, Angular, plain HTML

Import \`@kitn.ai/ui/web-components\` once, then use the tags directly. There are no
per-framework wrappers beyond React. In a template, remember that only scalars
can be bound as attributes — arrays, objects and functions must be assigned to
the web-component instance in code.

## Styling

${fence("import '@kitn.ai/ui/theme.css';", 'js')}

Import that through a build that runs **Tailwind** over it: the file carries a
Tailwind \`@theme\` block, and a bundler that ships it raw to a browser discards
that block. On a page with no build step use the \`<link>\` above, or
\`@kitn.ai/ui/theme.tokens.css\`, which is the pre-built plain-CSS token sheet.
The token names are in THEME.md.

## The Solid component names on the web-component pages

Each web-component page names the SolidJS component it wraps (\`ChatThread\`,
\`Conversations\`, …). **Those names are provenance, not import paths.** Of the
${solidExports.total} names that appear, ${solidExports.exported} are also exported from
\`@kitn.ai/ui\` for SolidJS consumers and ${solidExports.internal} are internal and
cannot be imported at all. The web-component pages mark which is which. If you are not
writing a Solid app, ignore them entirely and use the \`kai-*\` tag.

Two kinds of check. Both are mechanical: do not reason about whether your code
"feels right", **search it**.

## Part 1 — searches

Each item is a string that must not appear in what you produced. Every one has
been machine-checked against this catalog: it appears in the mistake it comes
from, and in **none** of the recommended forms — in either quote style — so a hit
is a real finding, not a style opinion. Where an item lists two strings they are
the same needle spelled with single and with double quotes; **check both**.

**Zero hits does not mean correct; a hit means definitely wrong.** Part 2 is the
half that does not depend on spelling.

${items}

## Part 2 — checks over the catalog's own lists

These need no needle. Run each over your finished output.

1. **Every \`kai-…\` tag you wrote must appear in WEB-COMPONENTS.md.** Extract every
   tag matching \`kai-[a-z-]+\` from your output and look each one up in the
   index. There are ${derived.webComponents.length} legal tags. A tag that is not on
   that list does not exist, and shipping it is worse than not answering — go
   back and say what is missing instead.
2. **Every \`@kitn.ai/ui…\` import specifier you wrote must appear in
   DELIVERY.md.** That table is the complete published surface; anything else
   fails to resolve at install time, which is the most expensive place to find
   out.
3. **Every prop you set must appear on that web component's page.** Not on a different
   web component's page: props are not shared between web components except the ones in
   SHARED-PROPS.md.
4. **Every prop you set as an ATTRIBUTE must be marked settable as an attribute
   on that page.** Anything marked "JS property only" must be assigned:
   \`el.prop = value\`.
5. **Every event you listen for must be listed on the web component you attached the
   listener to.** Not on a parent, not on \`document\` — except for the protocol
   exceptions listed in INVARIANTS.md under \`events-non-bubbling\`.
6. **Every \`MessagePart\` you construct must use a \`type\` from PARTS.md.**
   There are ${derived.partVariants.length}: ${derived.partVariants.map((v) => `\`${v}\``).join(', ')}.
7. **Every CSS custom property you set must appear in THEME.md**, spelled with
   the \`--kai-\` prefix.
8. **You imported no SSE parsing of your own.** If your output reads
   \`response.body\` and splits on \`data:\`, delete it and use the wire reader.

## Async faults: what is covered, and where the bound is

A fragment can fail after it returns three ways, and all three are trapped: an
unhandled rejection from a \`.then\`, an uncaught exception from a timer, and a
throw inside a **DOM event listener** — which is neither of the first two,
because jsdom routes a listener's exception to its virtual console where no
process-level handler sees it.

Blame is assigned STRUCTURALLY, not by the clock. A timer a fragment schedules is
owned by the case that scheduled it, however late it fires, because attributing
by "which case was running when it landed" sends the reader to correct code — a
50ms timer, or a chain of nested 0ms ones, lands inside the next example's
window. A rejection CREATED inside such a timer is owned the same way: the
window stays set across the callback and one macrotask beyond it, which is where
\`unhandledRejection\` fires.

**The residual, measured rather than assumed:** a rejection created somewhere no
case owns — a \`.then\` on a promise the harness itself made, resolving after
its case's drain — is still attributed by arrival. It fails the run either way;
what it can get wrong is which example it names.

A rejection that gets a handler shortly afterwards is **retracted** and is not a
failure at all, so a pack is never destroyed over a run that did nothing wrong.

The bound is time, not route. Each case is drained to quiescence, then the run
settles for **${SETTLE_MS}ms** before the floor gives a verdict; a fault inside
that window means **zero files written**. A fault later than it cannot be waited
for, so it is handled the other way round: a process-exit guard **removes the
pack** and exits non-zero, because a pack on disk must never outlive a run that
failed.
