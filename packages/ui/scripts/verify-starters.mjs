// GUARD — `npm run verify:starters`, run in the required CI `test` job.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
// -------------
// `examples/starters/*` holds the eight starter apps. Until this guard, NOTHING
// in CI built, typechecked or ran any of them: they were covered by code review
// alone. They are not just samples — `create-kai` scaffolds FROM them, so a
// starter that stops compiling ships straight into every scaffolded project,
// and the person who finds out is a new user on their first five minutes with
// the kit.
//
// The trigger was a five-starter refactor (each app's hand-rolled
// `streamFakeReply` replaced by the kit's shared `createMockResponder()`) that
// touched every composed-workspace starter with no automated check behind it.
//
// TWO CORPORA, ONE CLASSIFIER
// ---------------------------
// `examples/apps/*` is the iteration ladder's corpus: whole applications built
// with the kit rather than one minimal template per framework (see
// docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-19-rung-1-support-widget.md, "Rulings"). They
// are covered here rather than by a second script because there is nothing
// starter-SPECIFIC about the check: it builds a package and typechecks it. A
// second copy of this file would be a second place for the tier rules, the
// workspace cross-check and the CI flag refusal to drift.
//
// Both directories are walked by the SAME loop with the SAME hard-fail
// semantics, and neither may be empty or missing — an app corpus that quietly
// contains nothing while the summary line says everything passed is this file's
// oldest recurring defect, one directory over.
//
// The two are told apart only by the noun in an error message and by the
// relative path used to identify an entry. Names can collide across corpora
// (`examples/starters/react` and a future `examples/apps/react` are different
// packages), so the IDENTITY of an entry is its repo-relative path; `--only`
// still takes a bare name and refuses one that is ambiguous rather than picking.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
// ------------------------------------
// It runs each starter's REAL `build` — the same command a user runs — and,
// where that build does not already invoke a typechecker, its `typecheck` too.
// That catches the failures that actually happen here: a type error, a renamed
// or deleted export, an import specifier the kit no longer serves, a subpath
// missing from the exports map, a framework plugin that cannot process a file.
//
// It does NOT prove the app WORKS. A starter can build perfectly and render a
// blank page — wrong `kai-*` tag name, an array passed as an HTML attribute
// instead of a JS property, a listener bound to a bubbling event that does not
// bubble. Those are runtime contract failures and a bundler cannot see them.
// That layer is `verify:consumer` (registrations survive a real consumer
// bundler) and the `/consumer-regression` skill (real apps driven in a real
// browser). This guard is the compile floor beneath both, not a substitute.
//
// Deliberately NOT attempted: grepping the emitted bundles for `kai-*` tags to
// "prove" registration survived. Every web component's tag name appears in the kit's
// metadata whether or not the `customElements.define` calls were tree-shaken,
// so that check passes on a broken build. `verify:consumer` does this properly,
// against a packed tarball, by counting defines in the emitted chunk.
//
// THE TWO TIERS, DERIVED NOT LISTED
// ---------------------------------
// There is no hand-written roster of starters in this file. The set is read
// from the `examples/starters/` directory, and each one's tier is read from how
// it depends on the kit:
//
//   LINKED      "@kitn.ai/ui": "workspace:*"   a pnpm workspace member. Its deps
//                                              are already on disk from the root
//                                              `pnpm install`, so building it
//                                              costs only the build.
//   STANDALONE  "@kitn.ai/ui": "file:../../.." a plain npm consumer that is NOT a
//                                              workspace member (see the comment
//                                              at the bottom of pnpm-workspace.yaml).
//                                              Needs its own `npm ci` first.
//
// Anything else — a starter with no `@kitn.ai/ui` dependency, an unrecognised
// specifier, no `build` script, or a `build` that never reaches a typechecker
// and no `typecheck` script to make up for it — is a HARD FAILURE, not a skip.
// That is the point: a starter added next month cannot quietly fall outside the
// guard while the summary line still says every starter passed.
//
// The tier is cross-checked against pnpm-workspace.yaml, so the two facts cannot
// disagree. A starter declaring `workspace:*` while absent from that file gets a
// dangling link rather than the kit, which is a confusing runtime failure this
// turns into a clear one at the top of the run.
//
// COST — UPPER BOUNDS, NOT AN IDLE BASELINE
// -----------------------------------------
// One full cold run (both standalone node_modules deleted first, kit already
// built) took 1m28s wall:
//   LINKED (6):     react 4s · vue 4s · svelte 4s · vanilla 3s · solid 7s
//                   angular 11s                                = ~33s, no install
//   STANDALONE (2): nextjs 28s npm ci + 15s build
//                   tanstack-start 6s npm ci + 7s build+typecheck
//
// READ THESE AS CEILINGS. The box was NOT quiet: load average 17.56 with three
// other agents building in sibling worktrees, plus a browser and a VM. Expect
// the real numbers to be LOWER, never higher. The ~/.npm cache was also already
// warm, which is why nextjs and tanstack-start disagree so much on install time
// — a truly cold cache costs more, which is what the actions/cache step in
// test.yml is for. If you need a trustworthy figure, re-measure on an idle
// machine rather than trusting this block.
//
// Even at the ceiling that is ~1.5 min against a 30-minute job budget, which is
// why the guard covers EVERY starter rather than only the linked ones that need
// no install. The partial version was cheap to avoid, so it was not worth the
// dishonesty. The apps corpus is linked-tier and adds a build apiece; the run
// prints its own per-corpus counts and timings, so read those rather than this
// block, which is a measurement of one afternoon and not a roster.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/verify-starters.mjs               everything (what CI runs)
//   node scripts/verify-starters.mjs --linked-only skip the npm-ci tier (local, offline)
//   node scripts/verify-starters.mjs --only=react,vue   iterate on a few (local)
//   node scripts/verify-starters.mjs --only=examples/apps/support-widget  (qualified)
//   node scripts/verify-starters.mjs --fresh       re-run `npm ci` even if node_modules exists
//
// `--linked-only` and `--only` are REFUSED when $CI is set. They are local
// conveniences, and a guard that claims a corpus while silently covering a third
// of it is the exact failure this repo keeps paying for.
//
// Needs `nx build ui` first: every starter and app resolves `@kitn.ai/ui` to this
// package's compiled `dist/`, so an unbuilt tree is a hard error rather than a
// wall of confusing per-example resolution failures.

// ---- structural: a Solid starter imports the kit from "./solid" -------------
//
// WHY A SEPARATE CHECK, WHEN EVERY STARTER ALREADY BUILDS
// ------------------------------------------------------
// The build tier above CANNOT see this defect, and that is the whole reason this
// block exists. `src/solid.ts` is `export * from './index'` plus the Solid-only
// additions, so "./solid" is a compiler-guaranteed STRICT SUPERSET of ".". A
// Solid starter importing components from the root entry therefore compiles
// perfectly, for exactly as long as it happens to use only symbols that live on
// both. It is a specifier that WORKS while contradicting the documentation, and
// a compile gate cannot distinguish that from a correct one. The starter shipped
// this way and `verify:starters` was green over it.
//
// It matters because the root entry is not where the Solid surface lives. The
// full Solid catalog was deliberately moved OFF "." (it cost every React/Vue/
// Svelte/vanilla consumer +113,672 bytes, +19.2%, for components they cannot
// render), and `verify:solid-coverage` checks 79/79 against `@kitn.ai/ui/solid`
// and explicitly NOT against ".". A Solid consumer is told to import from one
// place. The starters are what create-kai scaffolds from, so a starter modelling
// the other one teaches every new project the wrong entry point, and #180 had
// already fixed the same defect in the MCP scaffolder's Solid branch.
//
// ROOT IS BANNED OUTRIGHT HERE, not merely discouraged: because "./solid" is a
// superset, a Solid app has no reason to reach for "." at all. Every OTHER
// subpath stays legal (`/state`, `/wire`, `/web-components`, ...) — those are
// framework-neutral and Solid consumers use them normally. This says nothing
// about the Vue/Svelte/vanilla starters, which import types from "." correctly.
//
// DERIVED, NOT LISTED. The Solid starters are the ones that DEPEND ON solid-js,
// read from each starter's own package.json. There is no `'solid'` literal
// naming a directory, so a second Solid starter added next month is covered on
// arrival rather than quietly falling outside a hand-written roster.
//
// It runs on EVERY invocation, before any build and regardless of --only /
// --linked-only. It is a few file reads with no build behind it, and a static
// contradiction should not be skippable by a flag whose purpose is to save build
// time — that is the coverage hole this file already refuses elsewhere.
//
// VACUITY. Three ways this could pass while checking nothing, all of them hard

// to scan, or it imports the kit from nowhere at all. "Found none, so nothing was
