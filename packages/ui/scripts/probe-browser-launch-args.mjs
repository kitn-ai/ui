/**
 * Does `vitest.config.ts`'s chromium hardening actually reach the browser?
 *
 * A green storybook run proves nothing here: the suite passes whether or not
 * `launchOptions` sits in a position the playwright provider reads. So this
 * probe ignores the config file and reads the one thing that cannot lie -- the
 * argv of the chromium process vitest actually launched.
 *
 * Two phases, because a naive "is the flag in argv?" check is itself a check
 * that proves nothing. Playwright's OWN chromium defaults already include
 * --disable-dev-shm-usage, --no-sandbox, --disable-renderer-backgrounding and
 * others from our list, so those flags are present whether or not our config
 * was honoured. Only flags playwright does not pass by itself can distinguish
 * the two states, and the probe works out which ones those are by measurement
 * rather than by assertion:
 *
 *   A. launch chromium through playwright with NO options and record its argv
 *      -> the empirical default set
 *   B. run a real `vitest run --project=storybook` and record the argv of the
 *      chromium IT launched
 *   verdict := over (our configured flags MINUS the defaults from A) only
 *
 * Exit 0 = every discriminating flag reached the process, no switch is
 *          duplicated, and no flag from FORBIDDEN_FLAGS is back. Also exit 0,
 *          vacuously and out loud, when the config configures no flags at all.
 * Exit 1 = any of those three failed.
 * Exit 2 = the probe could not measure: a phase never produced a browser, or
 *          flags are configured but every one is also a playwright default so
 *          their presence would prove nothing. Never read either as a pass.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/probe-browser-launch-args.mjs [--story <path>] [--out <file>]
