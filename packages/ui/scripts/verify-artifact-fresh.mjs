// Freshness guard for measurement runs: the built artifacts you are about to
// measure must be NEWER than every source they were built from.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
// -------------
// On 2026-08-18 a measurement demo ran the `kai` MCP against a `dist/` that had
// been built 15 hours before the tool it was measuring last changed. The run
// produced a tidy, confident finding list whose top three items were things the
// newer source already fixed. Nothing was wrong with the harness, the prompts or
// the analysis — every one of those was correct ABOUT THE WRONG TREE, and the
// whole run was worthless. That failure mode is silent by construction: a stale
// artifact loads, runs and answers exactly like a fresh one.
//
// This repo has no other check of this shape. Every existing guard is
// CONTENT-drift (`verify:generated`, `lint:catalog-drift`, …) — they ask whether
// a derived file matches its generator's current output. None of them asks the
// cheaper, more basic question: was this artifact produced AFTER the code it
// claims to represent?
//
// THE INVARIANT
// -------------
// For every artifact under measurement: artifact.mtime is STRICTLY greater than
// the mtime of every hand-written source in the package. One source at or newer
// than one artifact means the artifact may not contain that source, and any
// measurement taken against it is a measurement of history.
//
// An EQUAL mtime counts as stale. It is practically unreachable at millisecond
// resolution, but the tie has to break somewhere and it breaks fail-closed: at
// equal timestamps the order of the two writes is genuinely unknown, so the
// honest answer is "cannot confirm this artifact contains that source", and a
// guard whose whole purpose is to stop confident measurement of the wrong tree
// must not resolve its own ambiguity in favour of proceeding. It also keeps the
// code and this comment from disagreeing, which is the failure this note exists
// to prevent.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
// ---------------
//   1. Every artifact asked for EXISTS (a missing one names its exact path and
//      the command that produces it).
//   2. No scanned source has an mtime at or newer than the OLDEST checked
//      artifact (equal counts as stale — see THE INVARIANT).
//   3. It scanned a non-zero number of artifacts and a non-zero number of
//      sources — counting artifacts that RESOLVED, not merely ones that were
//      asked for, so "everything was skipped" can never read as a pass.
// On success it prints each artifact's SHA-256 and mtime, so a measurement run's
// ledger can record exactly which bytes were measured rather than "latest".
//
// WHY IT NEVER TRUSTS A BUILD'S EXIT CODE
// ---------------------------------------
// The obvious alternative — "run the build first, then measure" — is the thing
// that already failed. `nx build ui` CAN hit the NX cache, print "Successfully
// ran target build" and regenerate nothing, because the generators write their
// side effects into the SOURCE tree and a cache restore does not put them back
// (CLAUDE.md documents this; `verify-generated-sync.mjs` is built around the
// same trap). A cached build is indistinguishable from a successful one by exit
// code. So this guard never shells out to a build, never reads a build log, and
// never takes anyone's word for it: it stats the files on disk. The only input
// is timestamps, which no cache can fake.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A CI STEP
// -------------------------
// CI builds fresh immediately before it does anything else, so on CI this check
// cannot fail — it would be a check that passes vacuously forever, which this
// repo treats as worse than no check at all. The staleness only exists on a
// developer's or an agent's box, where `dist/` persists across sessions and
// branches. This is therefore a LOCAL guard: the mandatory first line of any
// measurement run or rung brief, run by hand or by the brief's own command list.
//
// SCOPE
// -----
// Sources are every file under `src/`, `scripts/` and `mcp/`, plus
// `package.json` (see SOURCE_DIRS — `mcp` is there because the MCP tree was
// `src/agent-tooling/` until 2026-09-02). Files the BUILD ITSELF writes back
// into those trees are excluded (see GENERATED_SOURCES) — otherwise a correctly
// built tree fails instantly, since postbuild's `build:api` writes
// `src/elements/element-meta.json` a second after `dist/kai.es.js`.
//
// Excluding them leaves no hole, and the proof is per entry, not a general
// claim: the build writes into THREE trees now — `src/` (prebuild + build:api),
// `mcp/` and `scripts/` (build:api and build:blocks in postbuild) — and each
// exclusion names the guard that owns those bytes (`verify:generated` for the
// `src/` and `mcp/` artifacts, `verify:blocks`' spawned `gen-blocks --check`
// for the driver pages). This guard covers hand-written source; those cover
// generated source. An entry with no owning guard belongs here only with a
// reason written beside it.
//
// A ZERO-SCAN RUN IS A HARD FAILURE. Resolve no artifacts, or find no sources,
// and this exits non-zero rather than reporting a clean tree. A runner that
// matched nothing and exited 0 is this repo's most expensive recurring defect.
//
