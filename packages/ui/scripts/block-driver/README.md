# block-driver — the V-1 harness

The composition spike's `fine-drive.mjs`
(`docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-31-composition-spike/cdn-widget-src/`)
generalized into a reusable Playwright/Chromium driver. A scenario module
declares pages, sequential UI states, user-level actions, behavioral probes,
computed-style probes and hard expectations as data; the driver runs them
light + dark, enforces zero console errors, writes a stable-named screenshot
per state (`<page>-<scheme>-<state>.png`) and a JSON verdict. Exit 1 on any
red.

## Layout

- `driver.mjs` — the runner. Flag reference in its header comment.
- `serve.mjs` — static page server; mounts the built `dist/` at `/kit/` the
  way a CDN serves `@kitn.ai/ui@<version>/dist/`.
- `port-holder.mjs` — who is listening on a port, shared by the two above.
- `scenarios/kai-chat-facade.mjs` — the facade's eight-state story (plus a
  reload-restore state), restated from `fine-drive.mjs` as data.
- `pages/kai-chat-facade/` — the harness page: the spike's facade widget page
  (index.html + app.js), unchanged in behavior.
- `pages/generated/<block>/` — GENERATED, gitignored (owner ruling
  2026-08-31: generated block forms are build artifacts, never committed).
  `gen-blocks.mjs` writes each block's CDN form rendered against the `/kit/`
  mount here during the build (`build:blocks`, in postbuild), so the driver
  runs the real generated form next to the authored parity pages under the
  same serve root. Build first, or the page 404s.
- `baselines/kai-chat-facade.json` — the recorded pre-refactor verdict
  (probe + computed-style values, per scheme per state).
- `baselines/screenshots/` — the pre-refactor screenshot set (committed, per
  the spike-shots precedent). `--shots <dir>` is REQUIRED and has no default:
  the driver used to write `./shots` beside the scenario, which for a block is
  inside the authored source tree and left ~60 PNGs of debris there. A block's
  committed set lives at `baselines/screenshots-<block>/`, the facade's at
  `baselines/screenshots/`; a gate passes a scratch dir.

## Modes

- **record** (`--record <file>`): run + write the verdict = the baseline.
- **check** (`--baseline <file>`): run + deep-diff every probe/style value
  against a recorded baseline; any mismatch is red.
- **parity** (`--pages a,b`): run two pages and diff them state-for-state
  (the spike's facade-vs-fine comparison; block-vs-facade later).

All modes also enforce each state's `expect` map and zero console
errors/warnings (`scenario.consoleIgnore` regexes waive named ones loudly).

## Task 2.2 gate (P-9 parity)

After refactoring the facade, from `packages/ui` (build first):

```sh
node scripts/block-driver/driver.mjs scripts/block-driver/scenarios/kai-chat-facade.mjs \
  --serve scripts/block-driver/pages/kai-chat-facade \
  --baseline scripts/block-driver/baselines/kai-chat-facade.json \
  --shots <after-shots-dir>
```

Green means every behavioral and computed-style value matches the recorded
pre-refactor facade, both schemes; the `<after-shots-dir>` set pairs with
`baselines/screenshots/` name-for-name for the owner's eyeball pass.

Port default is 8952; never point it at 4400/4401/8931. `verify-blocks.mjs`
takes 8954 and 8955, and the react runtime cell (`verify-blocks-react.mjs`,
which serves its own throwaway Vite app rather than `serve.mjs`) takes 8961
and 8962. This guard has been watched failing (a planted wrong expectation and
a planted page defect each went red with named states before the recorded
green). Re-plant one before trusting structural changes to the driver itself.

## Lifecycle, and a port that is already held

A run owns two child processes: `serve.mjs` (with `--serve`) and Chromium. Three
things end them now, and they cover different failures rather than restating each
other: a `finally` around the whole run (every throw and every rejected await in
this process), a `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` guard (a signal ends the process without
unwinding it, so no `finally` runs — `kill <pid>` on the driver is the case Ctrl-C
does not reach, because the shell delivers that to the whole process group), and a
synchronous `process.on('exit')` kill as the belt for an exit that skips both
(`process.exit()` does not unwind the stack, so a `finally` never runs for it).
Cleanup used to be two bare statements AFTER the run, so a scenario whose `ready`
threw left `serve.mjs` alive holding the port, and the next run then died on
EADDRINUSE instead of on its own defect.

With `--serve`, the driver now refuses to start when the port it is about to bind
is already held: it names the pid and the command line holding it, and says
whether that looks like a stale run. The lookup is `port-holder.mjs`, shared with
`serve.mjs`, which reports the same holder when its own bind fails — two messages
that would otherwise drift apart. The refusal fires only for `--serve`, because
with `--base` the port belongs to somebody else's server and a busy port there is
the normal case. Where `lsof` is unavailable, both say what they can instead of
naming a pid they guessed.

Two page-spec keys change what a run asserts, and both exist for a page that
mounts the same block in a DIFFERENT document. `skipLayout: true` drops every
probe the state named in `layoutProbes`, the `expect` entries over them, and
every `styleProbe`. It is a PAGE'S DECLARATION and it is never quiet: the driver
records every probe it skipped in the verdict (`skippedProbes` / `skippedStyles`)
and prints a `SKIP <page> -- skipLayout is declared on this page: …` line naming
them, so a green run over a page that skipped its geometry cannot read like a
green run that measured it. `skipLayout` is what the page's own author decides;
it is NOT a statement that such a probe is unmeasurable there -- support-widget's
four geometry probes, run against the react host with the flag off, came back at
the block page's own numbers (16 / 4 / 20 and a clear CTA), because each is a
difference between two boxes of the block's OWN elements and the emitted tree
imports the block's stylesheet. **No page declares it today**, so the react
runtime cell measures every probe its three blocks name and prints no SKIP line;
the key stays supported for a page that genuinely cannot carry one.
`consoleIgnore` on a page spec is MERGED with the
scenario's, so a page can tolerate its own host noise without relaxing the
zero-console rule everywhere else.

`react-host/` is the checked-in Vite app the react runtime cell copies into a
temp dir and installs the packed tarball into. Its dependency ranges are the
repo's own, pinned there rather than resolved fresh each run; the cell prints
what they resolved to.
