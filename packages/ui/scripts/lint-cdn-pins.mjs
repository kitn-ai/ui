// Staleness guard for HAND-TYPED CDN VERSION PINS of @kitn.ai/ui.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS IS BUILT FROM
// The docs tell people to pin an exact version for CDN use. That advice is
// correct -- a pinned URL is immutable, cacheable and SRI-able -- but every pin
// in the docs was a literal somebody typed once. The kit kept releasing; the
// literals did not move. When a Critical advisory landed against every version
// from 0.14.1 to 0.24.0, four copy-pasteable URLs across the docs and the npm
// README were still handing readers 0.20.1 and 0.16.0, both inside that range.
//
// The npm README is the worst of the four, and it is worth naming why: npm
// prints a deprecation warning on `npm install` of a deprecated version, and all
// 17 affected versions are deprecated. A CDN FETCH PRINTS NOTHING. So the one
// distribution channel with no safety net was the one carrying the stalest pin,
// on the page a prospective user sees first.
//
// THE INVARIANT
// A `@kitn.ai/ui@<version>` literal anywhere in first-party docs, examples or
// source must equal the version in packages/ui/package.json. Not "satisfies a
// range containing it" -- EQUAL.
//
// WHY EQUALITY, AND WHY NOT A RANGE
// A range check here would be a check that cannot fail. `^0.25.0` always
// includes 0.25.0, so "does the documented range admit the current version"
// is true by construction and would go green forever while the docs rotted.
// The two sides of THIS comparison are independent: a string a human typed into
// prose, and the manifest release-please rewrites. They drift apart on their
// own, every single release, which is exactly the failure being guarded.
//
// WHY NOT DERIVE THE PIN AT DOCS BUILD TIME INSTEAD
// Considered first, and rejected as the primary mechanism, for two reasons.
// (1) It cannot reach packages/ui/README.md, which is rendered by the npm
// registry from the published tarball -- there is no build step in that path at
// all, and that file is the worst offender. (2) In the docs the pins live inside
// inline code spans and fenced blocks, where MDX treats content as literal by
// design; making them interpolate would mean lifting the URL out of code
// formatting. That trades a real docs regression for a partial fix. A guard
// covers every file type uniformly, including plain markdown the registry reads.
//
// `--fix` rewrites every stale pin to the current version, so a MANUAL cleanup
// is one command rather than a hunt.
//
// WHO UPDATES THE PINS ON A RELEASE, AND WHY IT IS NOT `--fix`
// The version this compares against is the one release-please rewrites, so
// every release moves one side and not the other: the release commit itself was
// red on `8d56f1d7` (0.25.0 -> 0.25.1) with the publish going out anyway. The
// pins are therefore updated BY THE BUMP, via release-please `extra-files` in
// release-please-config.json, so the release commit is green by construction.
//
// Running `--fix` from a release job was the obvious alternative and is the
// more dangerous one. `--fix` rewrites every pin it considers stale, so its
// blast radius is "whatever the scan matched"; a NEW historical narrative
// written without a waiver would be silently rewritten into a falsehood by an
// unattended job. release-please only ever touches a line a human annotated
// with `x-release-please-start-version`/`-end`, so an un-annotated line -- the
// exact shape a historical record has -- CANNOT be rewritten by the release. A
// pin somebody forgets to annotate is simply left stale, which turns the
// RELEASE PR red on this very guard, before anything publishes. That is the
// failure direction worth having.
//
// `--check-release-wiring` is what keeps that true: it asserts every live pin
// is actually reachable by the bump, so "forgot to annotate" fails on the PR
// that adds the pin rather than on the next release.
//
// WHY REGEX HERE, WHEN THE SIBLING GUARDS INSIST ON A REAL PARSE
// lint-attachment-object-urls records that a text-window scanner mis-lexed its
// own input and blanked a real defect away. That reasoning does not transfer,
// because this is not matching a CODE SHAPE. The token is a package specifier
// that appears in prose, in link text, in inline code and in fenced HTML with
// equal danger -- there is no syntax tree containing all four. The pattern is
// fully anchored on both ends (`@kitn.ai/ui@` then a semver), so there is no
// lexical state to get wrong: it either is that specifier or it is not.
//
// HISTORICAL RECORDS ARE WAIVED, NOT REWRITTEN
// Some in-scope files narrate real past releases ("the run that published
// @kitn.ai/ui@0.24.0 then died"). Rewriting those to the current version would
// falsify a record to satisfy a linter. They carry a parsed directive instead,
// on the line or the line above:
//
//   lint-cdn-pins: historical -- <reason, >= 15 chars>
//
// A directive and not prose, for the reason lint-silent-drops gives: the defect
// this guard is built from was ALREADY surrounded by prose explaining that the
// pin was deliberate, so a rule honouring comments would have passed it
// unchanged. The waiver covers only the line it sits on.
//
// A ZERO-MATCH RUN IS A HARD FAILURE, and this is deliberate. It is the opposite
// call from lint-attachment-object-urls, which scans for a FORBIDDEN pattern
// where finding none is the healthy steady state. This scans for pins the docs
// deliberately RECOMMEND and therefore knows exist; finding none means the walk
// broke, and a broken walk would pass every stale pin in the tree forever.
