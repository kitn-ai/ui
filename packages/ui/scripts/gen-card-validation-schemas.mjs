//
// WHY A PROJECTION AND NOT THE AUTHORED SCHEMAS
// --------------------------------------------
// The native card dispatcher validates every envelope in the BROWSER, so the schema
// data is a client-bundle cost paid by every consumer of this library. The authored
// documents are mostly prose the browser never reads: descriptions written for a
// model, `$id`, `title`, `x-kai-*` UI hints. Stripping them and keeping only the
// keywords `validateAgainstSchema` actually acts on is a large win for zero
// behaviour change, because `walk()` reads a fixed set of keys and ignores every
// other one it is handed.
//
// Measured on this tree, the 7 card-data schemas as one JSON payload
// (`JSON.stringify`, then gzip -9):
//   authored   14,916 B / 4,588 B gzip
//   projected   3,780 B /   855 B gzip
// The plan estimated 4,973 / 1,005 for all ELEVEN documents including the four
// contract shapes, which is why these numbers are lower rather than the plan being
// wrong. The ratio holds: the projection is about 19% of the authored bytes.
//
// The number that actually matters is the BUNDLE delta, which is a different
// measurement and was taken separately: build the package, stub
// CARD_VALIDATION_SCHEMAS to `{}`, build again, diff. Real gzip cost of shipping the
// projection to a browser:
//   dist/index.js            140,919 -> 140,085   =  +834 B gzip
//   dist/register-impl-*.js  182,348 -> 181,573   =  +775 B gzip
//   dist/kai.es.js           unchanged (lazy loader shell, holds no card code)
// The payload figure above is a good proxy for it, which is why both are recorded.
//
// THE GUARD THIS SCRIPT IS
// ------------------------
// Every keyword at every keyword position in every card schema must be in exactly
// one of three tables:
//   ENFORCED       derived from the BODY of validateAgainstSchema, not from a list
//   STRIPPED       annotation/meta; carries no constraint, so dropping it is lossless
//   NOT_ENFORCED   a real constraint this validator does not implement, named here
//                  with a written reason
// Anything else is a hard failure naming the keyword, the file and the path. A
// silent skip list would defeat the point: the whole hazard is a keyword landing in
// a schema, looking like it constrains the model's output, and constraining nothing.
//
// `verify:schemas` and `verify:tool-schemas` are about the SERVER surface (what a
// provider will accept). This is about the CLIENT surface (what we can actually
// check at render time). They are different questions and neither subsumes the other.
//
// THE ENFORCED SET IS READ OUT OF THE VALIDATOR'S BODY, ON PURPOSE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Not out of the `JsonSchema` interface. The interface is a declaration and can
// drift from the implementation in the one direction that matters: adding
// `multipleOf?: number` to the interface without adding a check to `walk()` would
// make a hand-list-based guard call `multipleOf` enforced while nothing enforces it.
// Reading `schema.<keyword>` accesses out of the function body means the guard's
// notion of "enforced" IS the code that enforces it.
//
// THE CARD-TYPE LIST IS READ OUT OF `cardSchemas`, FOR THE SAME REASON
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// It used to be a literal array here, and the only check over it compared the
// GENERATED module back against this file's own array — both sides moved together,
// so it could not fail. Measured on this tree before the fix: adding an eighth type
// to `cardSchemas` in src/schemas/index.ts left `verify:card-validation` printing
// "in sync (7 card schemas)" and card-validate-schemas.sync.test.ts green, while
// `CARD_VALIDATION_SCHEMAS` had no entry for it — so `validateCardData` returned
// `null` ("nothing to check") for every envelope of that type and the model's
// untrusted `data` reached the card unvalidated. Silently.

/**
 * The card-DATA types, in declaration order, read from the `cardSchemas` object
 * literal in src/schemas/index.ts.
 *
 * That map is the source of truth: it is what `cardTools()` offers a model, what
 * `createCardRegistry()` defaults `use` to, and what `cardSchemaNames` publishes.
 * The other four documents in the schema directory (`card-envelope`, `card-event`,
 * `form.result`, `tasks.result`) live in `contractSchemas` instead — contract
 * shapes, not card data, so nothing dispatches on them and projecting them would
 * ship bytes the dispatcher can never use.
 *
 * WHY A PARSE AND NOT AN IMPORT. This runs in `prebuild`, so `dist/schemas/index.js`
 * either does not exist yet or is the previous build's — the same stale-artifact trap
 * `dist/custom-elements.json` set for the MCP tests. Bundling the `.ts` (the
 * packages/create-kai `scripts/load-ts.mjs` precedent) would need `esbuild`, which is
 * not a dependency of this package and resolves only by walking up into the
 * workspace root, and would execute `registry.ts`, `tool-defs.ts`, `from-tool-call.ts`
 * and every schema document in the directory to learn a list of keys. `typescript` IS a devDependency
 * here and scripts/lint-silent-drops.mjs already reads the `MessagePart` union out of
 * src/web-components/chat-types.ts exactly this way.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT SILENTLY UNDER-COUNT. A short list is the dangerous outcome: it drops
 * a card type from the browser validator while every keyword check still passes. So
 * this refuses anything it cannot enumerate exactly — no second declaration of the
 * name, no initializer that is not a plain (optionally frozen) object literal, no
 * spread, no computed key, no duplicate, no empty map. Each throws naming what it
 * found. There is deliberately NO floor count: a fully enumerated literal IS the
 * answer, and a hand-typed minimum would be one more number to rot.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, ON PURPOSE. Whether the two maps between them account for
 * every file in src/primitives/card-schemas/ and for nothing else. `verify:schemas`
 * already asserts exactly that, against the BUILT entry, with a self-test. A second
 * copy of that policy here is how the two would drift.

// The real tree is the one case that proves nothing about detection: `readCardTypes`
// returns seven names there whether or not any of the refusals below still work. So
// each is driven with a source crafted to trip exactly it, and the clean case is
// asserted to return the exact keys — a parse that always threw would otherwise
// "pass" every negative case.
//
// This is the half the old arrangement never had. `verify:card-validation --check`
// compared the generated module against the generator's OWN array, so both sides
// moved together and no state of the tree could make it red.
