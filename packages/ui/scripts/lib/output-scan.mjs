/**
 * THE UNITS THE GATES ACTUALLY SCAN: every code file, plus every fenced code
 * block inside a prose file.
 *
 * Fences are included because of a real hole. Several scenarios — the debugging
 * one especially — are answered as prose with the fix in a fenced block, and a
 * gate that only read `.ts` files saw nothing at all. It then scored a clean
 * pass on the strength of having opened zero files, taking a third of that
 * scenario's weight for it.
 *
 * Prose OUTSIDE a fence is still never scanned, and that is not an oversight: an
 * answer that says "there is no <kai-datagrid> in this kit" is the best possible
 * answer to the refusal scenario, and flagging it for naming the thing it
 * declined to invent would punish exactly the behaviour the deck exists to
 * reward. The fence is the boundary between "here is code I am giving you" and
 * "here is me talking about code".
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL, and it applies to BOTH evaluator-run gates rather than only
 * the tag one:
 *
 *  - `gateElementsExist` reads a fenced `<kai-datagrid>` as a proposal even when
 *    the surrounding prose says "do not write this".
 *  - `gateAuditClean` has the identical shape: a ```ts block illustrating
 *    `chat.messages.push(m)` as the WRONG form fires `reactivity-two-halves#0`,
 *    which is the pack's own teaching example quoted back at it.
 *
 * Accepted in both cases. The alternative — ignoring fences — silently
 * un-measures every prose-shaped answer, which is the larger and quieter error,
 * and a false positive here is visible in the report where a false negative is
 * not. A judge who sees it can attribute it as a `pack-defect`.
 *
 * Each unit carries a `lang`: the file's extension for a real file, the
 * normalised fence language for a fenced block. The two scanning gates ignore
 * it — they search text — but a caller that has to WRITE the unit to disk (the
 * `compiles` gate does) needs to know what it is, and re-deriving that from the
 * name would be a second definition of the same fact.
