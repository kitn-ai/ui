// This was moved here out of `lint-silent-drops.mjs` unchanged. It reads the
// union in `src/web-components/chat/chat-types.ts` through the TypeScript parser rather
// than restating the members, so a seventh variant is picked up with no edit
// here -- the same reason `verify:scaffold` derives its list from that file.
//
// Callers pass the source TEXT, not a path: the two callers anchor
// `chat-types.ts` differently (one off `--package-root`, one off its own
// location) and neither should have to agree with the other about that.

// while catching nothing extra. It exists to catch a parse that silently
// collapsed to a couple of members.
