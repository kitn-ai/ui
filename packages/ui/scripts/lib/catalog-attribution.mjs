// THE CATALOG IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS.
//
// The spec asserts the mechanism and never supplies it: "whatever the agent
// cannot build names exactly what the catalog is missing". That sentence is only
// true if something actually performs the attribution, and nothing did. This is
// that thing.
//
// The rule it enforces: EVERY FINDING NAMES THE CATALOG RECORD THAT SHOULD HAVE
// PREVENTED IT. A finding with no attribution is a complaint about a model; a
// finding with an attribution is a proposed change to the catalog. Only the
// second kind is worth the cost of a run, so the first kind is refused.
//
// Attributions are RESOLVED against the catalog, not accepted as prose. Naming
// an invariant that does not exist, or proposing a "missing" invariant whose id
// is already taken, or claiming a web component has no description when it has one —
// each is a hard error. Without resolution the analysis degrades into free text
// within two runs, which is the state it is replacing.

/**
 * The kinds, and what each one must name to be resolvable.
 *
 * `not-a-catalog-gap` is the escape hatch and it is deliberately the most
 * expensive one to use: it must quote the page and the line that already said
 * the thing. Without that cost every finding lands there and the analysis
 * produces nothing.
