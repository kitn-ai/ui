// THE RUBRIC. Weighted dimensions, 0-10 anchors, one comparable score, and a
// severity ladder defined by RUNTIME IMPACT rather than by how bad it feels.
//
// Two structural commitments, both of which exist because a score that can only
// be argued about is worth nothing:
//
// 1. A dimension is EITHER mechanically gated OR judged, never a blend. Where a
//    machine can answer ("does it compile", "does every tag exist", "does it
//    stream"), the machine answers and the judge may not overrule it. Supplying
//    a judged score for a mechanical dimension is a hard error, and so is
//    supplying a gate result for a judged one. That is what "machine-checkable
//    gates UNDER the judged score" has to mean if it is to mean anything.
//
// 2. A mechanical dimension with NO gate result is a hard error, not a pass and
//    not a skip. This branch has been bitten repeatedly by a green that meant
//    "the check never ran"; an unrun gate must be as loud as a failed one.
//
// Nothing in this module reads the filesystem, invokes a model, or knows what an
// API key is. The catalog facts it needs are passed in.

/**
 * SEVERITY IS RUNTIME IMPACT. Not "how wrong does this look" — what does the
 * consumer see. The ladder is ordered by what the user of the built app loses.
 *
 * `cap` is the highest score the affected dimension may take once a finding at
 * that severity is recorded. This is what gives severity teeth: a judge cannot
 * award 9 for wiring topology on output whose wiring does not connect.
