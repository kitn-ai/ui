// THE FLOOR STAGE. Every `examples[].right` in the invariant records is EXECUTED
// here, and where the example makes a behavioural claim the claim is asserted.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not hypothetical. Task 5 shipped three defects in
// which the recommended code was structurally perfect and behaviourally wrong: a
// pair whose `wrong` form was a subset of its own `right` form (so the audit
// would have fired on correct output), `right` forms importing kit internals no
// consumer can reach, and guarded forms that THREW on an unparseable URL where
// the statement requires them to return false. Structure told you nothing about
// any of them. Running the code tells you about all three.
//
// So: if the catalog's own advice does not run, nothing downstream is worth
// measuring, and the pack refuses to be built.
//
// WHAT A HARNESS IS, AND WHY EVERY EXAMPLE NEEDS ONE
// -------------------------------------------------
// The `right` forms are CONSUMER FRAGMENTS, not programs: they carry free
// variables (`el`, `chat`, `source`, `card`, `messages`) that a consumer's own
// code would have bound. A harness supplies those bindings and then asserts what
// the example claims. Missing harness = HARD FAILURE, never a skip, and so is a
// harness with an EMPTY `cases` list: an empty list ran the loop zero times and
// reported PASS, which is the exact shape of vacuity this stage exists to
// prevent. Both are checked, and both are watched failing in `--self-test`.
//
// A dangling harness -- one whose example was deleted or renumbered -- is also a
// hard failure, in the other direction. Otherwise the table rots into a set of
// checks over code that no longer exists while reporting a healthy count.
//
// ASYNC CONTINUATIONS ARE NOT OUTSIDE THE MEASUREMENT. `execute` awaits the
// fragment's own IIFE, which resolves the moment the fragment RETURNS -- so a
// throw inside a `.then`, a timer or a listener happens afterwards, in the vm
// realm, and used to vanish. `withAsyncFaultTrap` spans execution AND the
// harness check, drains the queues, and turns any late rejection into a
// failure. `upgrade-race` is entirely about what happens in a `.then`, so
// without this its whole subject was unmeasured.
//
// HONESTY ABOUT STAND-INS. Not one example runs against the real registered
// web component: this is a Node script and the web components need a built bundle and the
// Solid runtime. Every harness therefore names its stand-ins in `stubs`,
// including the ones it would be easy to leave unstated -- the jsdom document,
// the plain object standing in for an element, the JSX factory. The report
// prints them, and the pack's own wording says "executed against these
// stand-ins" rather than "executed", because the second sentence is not true.
// Where a stand-in is the SUBJECT of the claim, the harness carries a
// `corroborate` step that checks the real thing by another route.

// THE FAULT SINK -- one, for the whole process

//
// THREE SOURCES, and the third was missing until review found it. A fragment
// can fail after it returns in a `.then` (an unhandled rejection), in a timer
// (an uncaught exception) -- and inside a DOM EVENT LISTENER, which is neither:
// jsdom catches a listener's exception and routes it to its VIRTUAL CONSOLE, so
// no process-level handler ever sees it. `events-non-bubbling#0`'s right form
// IS a listener, so that hole sat on the live path, and the floor printed PASS
// over a listener that threw.
//
// ONE SINK, INSTALLED ONCE, rather than listeners added and removed per case.
// Per-case listeners meant a fault arriving between two windows was blamed on
// whichever window happened to be open next -- a chain of five nested 0ms
// timers outlived the drain and was attributed to the NEXT example. Faults now

/**
 * derived.json and web-component-meta.json are written by the same `build:api` run, so
 * they agree by construction -- until one of them is regenerated alone. The pack
 * reads the web-component SPINE from derived.json (the tag list, the scalar/fn flags,
 * the index's counts) and the prose from web-component-meta.json (types, defaults,
 * slots, docs), so a divergence produces web-component pages that quietly contradict
 * the index the pack calls complete. Decide loudly: fail instead.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, per element, over props and events. A one-directional tag
 * membership check -- what this was before review -- passes on an extra tag in
 * web-component-meta, on a prop dropped from either side, and on a `fn`/`scalar` flag
 * that no longer matches the printed type. The last of those is S3's whole
 * scoring line, so it is cross-checked against the generator's rule rather than
 * merely compared.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT SEE, stated rather than implied: nothing here can tell
 * a correct prop TYPE from a plausible wrong one. `type: 'ThisDoesNotExist'` on
 * a non-function prop agrees with everything and packs clean. Types are checked
 * by `verify:generated` regenerating the artifact, not by this.
