// Coverage guard for the CI build artifact's upload glob.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
// The split gives one leg the build and hands its output to four others through
// an artifact. That artifact's `path:` list is the new `outputs:` list, and it
// has the same failure mode the NX one has: a build-written path that is not in
// it is SILENTLY ABSENT downstream. `postbuild` never runs in a downstream leg,
// so anything it writes into the source tree exists only if this list names it.
// coupling-map's `nx.json build.outputs` row called that hazard "local only";
// the split makes it live, and this is what closes it.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   1. The glob list is READ from the workflow's upload step, never restated
//      here. A renamed step is a hard failure, not a silently empty list.
//   2. Every glob lives under `packages/ui/`. actions/upload-artifact roots the
//      artifact at the least common ancestor of its paths, so a glob outside
//      that directory silently moves the artifact root and every downstream
//      `download-artifact` lands its files in the wrong place. Nothing else in
//      CI would say so; the legs would just fail as if the build were broken.
//   3. Every gitignored path that appeared under `packages/ui` BETWEEN the
//      pre-build snapshot and now is covered by a glob, or is one of the
//      runtime caches listed below with a written reason.
//
// IT CANNOT PASS VACUOUSLY. No snapshot is a hard failure (a diff against
// nothing covers nothing). A post-build `git status` that reports no ignored
// path at all under `packages/ui` is a hard failure too: `node_modules/` is
// always there on a real tree, so an empty read means the command, the scope or
// the parse broke rather than the tree being clean. `--self-test` runs the
// analyzers against known-bad and known-good inputs first.
//
// Usage:
//   ARTIFACT_GLOB_BEFORE=<snapshot> node packages/ui/scripts/verify-artifact-glob.mjs
//   node packages/ui/scripts/verify-artifact-glob.mjs --before <snapshot>
//   node packages/ui/scripts/verify-artifact-glob.mjs --self-test
