// Size budget for llms-full.txt.
//
// WHY A CEILING AT ALL
// llms-full.txt is the whole-API reference an AI coding agent ingests, and it
// only stays useful while it stays SMALL ENOUGH TO USE. Two costs grow with the
// byte count, and both degrade quietly: grep precision (more near-duplicate
// rows means more false hits per query) and whole-file ingestion cost (agents
// that cannot or do not navigate pay for every byte on every read). The file is
// generated, so it grows as a SIDE EFFECT of unrelated work — a new web component, a
// fatter doc comment, a new generated section — and nothing else in the tree
// prices that growth. This guard makes growth a conscious act: the author who
// moves the number is the one who read this comment.
//
// THE CEILING, AND THE BASELINE IT WAS SET FROM
// 2026-08-25 baseline: 294,399 bytes measured (84 elements, 122 state/wire
// exports, after the index-pointer regeneration + the #320 dist/llms removal).
// The ceiling is that plus ~14% headroom — enough for normal drift (a handful of new web components, doc
// polish), not enough for a new embedded corpus to ride in unnoticed.
//
// Raise it ONLY with a note in the style of verify-pack-weight.mjs: what grew,
// why the growth is genuinely needed, and why trimming or restructuring
// (pointers from llms.txt into external artifacts, thinner tables, moving
// detail behind the Custom Elements Manifest) was not the better fix.
//
// 2026-08-31 raise: 328 → 344 KiB. Measured 341,927 bytes at 96 elements /
// 123 state/wire exports. What grew: blocks-and-parts phase 1 — SEVEN new
// public web components (kai-panel, kai-panel-header, kai-tab-bar, kai-tab-bar-item,
// kai-view-stack, kai-view, kai-row: ~5 KB of generated element reference) plus
// the new "Icon roster" section (owner-ruled P-8: the 77 curated names were
// enumerated NOWHERE an agent could see, so unknown names got guessed and
// painted as literal text — spike finding F-7; ~2.7 KB, indexed from llms.txt
// per FULL_ONLY_SECTIONS). Neither is trimmable without unshipping the thing:
// the web components are real public API and the roster's whole value is being the
// complete list inline. New headroom is ~2 KiB — deliberately tight, the next
// batch of web components pays its own toll here again.
//
// 2026-09-22 raise: 344 → 355 KiB. Measured 352,800 bytes at 100 elements /
// 123 state/wire exports. What grew: the attachment lightbox and the image split, both of them
// element reference an agent reads HERE. `kai-lightbox` is a new element (open/show/hide/toggle,
// `show-close`, `close-on-content-click`, three parts); `kai-image-artifact` is a new element while
// `kai-image` changed meaning (the payload props moved out, `src` moved in); `image-preview` landed
// on three elements that render attachments; `ImageArtifact` brought its own props. Trimming was
// not the better fix: the growth is one row per real prop of real public API, and the alternative
// (pointers into the Custom Elements Manifest) would hide the per-element API from the file an agent
// reads first. 355 KiB keeps the same ~3% headroom over the measurement that the baseline and the
// previous raise both used.
