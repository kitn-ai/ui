// Compile the `kai` MCP scaffolder's EMITTED code with real `tsc --strict`.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
// -------------
// Every line the scaffolder emits lives inside a string literal, so no gate in
// this repo compiles it. `scaffold.test.ts` asserts over those strings, which
// catches wording but cannot catch a type error, a missing required prop, or an
// unused import. Those are exactly what a consumer hits: `npm create vite` turns
// on `noUnusedLocals`, so a single unreferenced name in an emitted import block
// fails `npm run build` in a stock app on the first try.
//
// This script generates the real scaffold output, writes it to disk as real
// files, resolves `@kitn.ai/ui` through the package's REAL exports map and
// shipped `.d.ts`, and runs `tsc` over the lot. Defects it has already caught:
//
//   · `applyToolOutput` named in a live import while only the COMMENTED-OUT tool
//     loop referenced it            → TS6133, breaks `npm run build`
//   · `sourcesEl.sources` on a bare `HTMLElement` in the svelte template
//                                   → TS2339
//   · `<Artifact src=… />` missing its required `files` prop
//                                   → TS2741
//
// HOW IT STAYS HONEST
// -------------------
// A green run proves nothing if the types resolved to `any`. Before the real
// matrix, `selfTest()` compiles probes that MUST fail: a wrong-type assignment
// and an unused import in every project, plus a host-typings probe in each route
// project. If any of them compiles, the harness is broken rather than the
// scaffolder, and this script exits non-zero saying so.
//
// SCOPE
// -----
// The integration and surface axes are DERIVED from `listIntegrations()` /
// `listSurfaceProbes()` at run time (see `loadCatalogAxes`). They used to be
// hand-written arrays, which made this gate one-directional: adding a catalog
// entry did NOT add coverage and nothing failed to say so — `openai` and
// `anthropic` both landed in the catalog and compiled ZERO times while this
// script printed success at its old 432/99 counts. Registering an integration
// now moves the cell counts by itself.
//
// Cell counts are therefore NOT fixed, and the figures below are illustrative of
// the current catalog rather than a target to hold: writing an expected count
// here would restore the same coupling, since the hand that adds an integration
// would be the hand that updates the number. The script prints what it actually
// ran; read that, not this comment.
//
// FRONT END: 7 surfaces × 11 integrations × 8 TS frameworks = 616 compiled
// cells, at one placement. `placement` is the fourth axis and is left at
// 'full-page' on purpose: it only ever changes an inline CSS string, so the
// extra 3x compiles the same types again.
//
// THE SURFACE AXIS IS A COMPONENTS LIST, NOT AN ARCHETYPE ID, and that swap is
// worth reading carefully because the cell count did NOT move at the time — 528
// before, 528 after — while the coverage did. (It has moved since, and only by
// the mechanism this file exists to enforce: registering the `attachments`
// preset added a fifth capability, which added a seventh surface probe, which
// added 88 cells with nobody editing a number here.)
//
// Before: the six archetype ids. That is five distinct `components` lists, not
// six, because `support-widget` and `drop-in-chat` carry the same components and
// differ only in `defaultPlacement`, which this matrix pins. So one cell in six
// re-compiled the previous cell's types, and the printed 528 overstated what was
// covered by exactly that much.
//
// After: `listSurfaceProbes()` — none, each capability alone, and ALL of them.
// Distinct lists, so the duplicate is gone, and the cell it freed is spent on
// the maximal surface: chat + sources + tool + reasoning + artifact + resizable +
// voice-input + file-upload + attachments. That one is the whole reason the axis
// changed. No archetype can
// express it — `workspace` has no `kai-tool` so it emits no card round trip, and
// `agentic` has no artifact pane — so it is simultaneously the surface a builder
// most obviously wants (a workspace that renders the tool calls that produced the
// artifact), the surface `create-kai`'s feature multi-select makes reachable, and
// the only cell where `isWorkspace`'s split layout and the tool loop + card
// registry are emitted into the same file. It had never been compiled.
//
// `assertSurfacesAreDistinct` fails if the axis ever degenerates back into
// repeated cells, and `assertPresetsAreData` keeps every preset checked —
// harder than before, by requiring each to be byte-identical to `renderSurface`
// over its own components rather than merely compiling on its own.
//
// ROUTES: 11 integrations × 11 frameworks = 121 cells, of which 99 reach tsc: the
// 11 `mock` cells carry no backend by design (it streams in the browser) and the
// 11 `pydantic-ai` cells are Python, so they go to `pythonCheck` instead. The
// framework axis is WIDER here than the front end's eight because `express`,
// `worker` and `fastapi` are backend-only targets a consumer can ask for
// directly. `html` and `fastapi` cannot host a route of their own but still emit
// one to run elsewhere, which is why they are in the matrix rather than skipped.
// The archetype axis is absent because `chooseRoute` never reads the archetype;
// `assertRoutesAreSurfaceIndependent` proves that rather than assuming it, so
// the day a route starts varying by archetype this stops silently checking one
// sixth of the matrix.
//
// The FRONT END compiles under three tsc PROJECTS, not one, because two
// frameworks cannot share a tsconfig with the react-jsx family without failing
// for harness reasons rather than real ones:
//   · angular — needs `experimentalDecorators` for @Component.
//   · solid   — needs `jsx: preserve` + `jsxImportSource: solid-js`; under
//               react-jsx every Solid component would be checked against React's
//               JSX namespace and the whole file would error spuriously.
// Each project gets its own copy of the anti-theatre self-test, so a green
// angular/solid run is as trustworthy as the default one.
//
// The `html` target IS compiled now, and that is a change worth stating: it used
// to be excluded because SCAF-19 kept its logic as plain JS in an inline
// `<script>`. That exclusion mirrored the consumer's own blind spot — a stock
// `vanilla-ts` app builds with `tsc && vite build` and scopes its tsconfig to
// `"include": ["src"]`, so an inline script is type-checked by nothing, and a
// call to a function that does not exist still left `npm run build` exiting 0.
// The scaffolder emits `src/main.ts` instead, so those 54 cells join the matrix.
// `htmlStructureCheck` keeps only what tsc cannot judge: one chat element and one
// submit listener in the whole scaffold (which caught ollama emitting a second
// front end under the BACKEND ROUTE heading), and that index.html LOADS the
// module rather than carrying the logic inline again.
//
// The `angular` target is only PARTLY visible to tsc: the component's TEMPLATE
// lives in a string literal that tsc never parses (Angular's own ngtsc does).
// `angularStructureCheck` covers the part tsc cannot — CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA
// present, exactly one <kai-chat>, arrays bound as `[prop]` PROPERTIES and not
// attributes, the kai-submit listener — and the template's real proof is
// `ng build` in a throwaway app.
//
// The `solid` target is fully visible to tsc and still has a hole tsc cannot
// reach: it is the only framework that does NOT render through <kai-chat>, so it
// composes the MessagePart switch itself, and a `<Switch>` missing a `<Match>`
// compiles perfectly while that part renders nothing at runtime.
// `solidPartCoverageCheck` asserts a branch per variant, with the variant list
// derived from the union rather than restated. See its own comment for how that
// shipped broken.
//
// The GENERATIVE-UI CARD round trip is the same class of hole one level up, and
// `cardRoundTripCheck` covers it. Cards are three pieces with no type relating
// them — the registry, `cardTools()`, `cardFromToolCall()` — and any two of them
// compile perfectly while nothing ever reaches the screen. Derived from the
// scaffolder's own `cardEmitPlan` over the full matrix, never from a count.
//
// BLOCK (2), THE BACKEND ROUTE, IS COMPILED TOO — see `routeCheck` below.
//
// It was not, for most of this file's life: `frontEnd()` sliced the emitted text
// at `=== (2) BACKEND ROUTE ===` and threw away everything under it, so the
// server half of every scaffold — auth, status forwarding, the provider call,
// SSE framing — had never been type-checked by any gate in this repo. That is
// how a Next-only route reached five frameworks, how `pi` shipped a template
// referencing variables it never declares, and how the dropped-status bug
// survived. The first run of `routeCheck` found TS2339 on
// `await request.json()` in all seven TypeScript integrations.
//
// Routes need typings the front end does not, and they are REAL packages
// (@sveltejs/kit, @tanstack/react-start, express, @cloudflare/workers-types,
// @angular/ssr, ai, @langchain/*, @mastra/client-js), added as devDependencies.
// They are deliberately NOT stubbed: a hand-written `declare module` would
// resolve every call to `any` and recreate the blind spot with extra steps,
// letting a wrong route pass. The one thing that IS hand-written is each
// framework's GENERATED file — SvelteKit's `./$types`, wrangler's `Env` — which
// is reproduced exactly as the framework's own codegen writes it and typed
// entirely through the real package.
//
// Routes compile under THREE projects, because the host decides the types and
// the host is what block (2) gets wrong:
//   · route-node   — express, Angular SSR, and the Vite dev-server middleware.
//                    `lib: ES2023` + `types: ["node"]` + `module: nodenext`, NO
//                    DOM: this is a stock `npm create vite` tsconfig.node.json,
//                    and it is what makes `await request.json()` `unknown`
//                    (undici) instead of `any`. It is also the ONLY project here
//                    that resolves the kit under node16/nodenext, which is the
//                    one mode where a missing extension in our shipped .d.ts
//                    degrades the whole public API to `any` — see its entry in
//                    PROJECTS.
//   · route-web    — Next, SvelteKit, TanStack Start. DOM lib present, which is
//                    what those frameworks' own tsconfigs ship.
//   · route-worker — Cloudflare. `@cloudflare/workers-types` + node, matching the
//                    nodejs_compat setup the emitted route itself tells you to use.
// A route is assigned to a project by the runtime the SCAFFOLDER declares for it
// ("# Runtime: …"), not by the requested framework, so a fallback route is
// checked against the host it will really run on. An unrecognised runtime label
// is a hard failure rather than a skip — otherwise a new host would silently
// stop being compiled, which is the bug this whole section exists to prevent.
//
// `.vue` / `.svelte` are not TS files, so their `<script>` blocks are lifted
// verbatim into `.ts`. Lifting separates the script from its template, which
// makes every template-visible top-level binding look unused, so a `void [...]`
// footer names the column-zero DECLARATIONS the template would have read.
// Imports are deliberately excluded from that footer: an unused import is the
// defect class under test.
//
// COST AND WHERE IT RUNS
// ----------------------
// ~16s wall clock for the front-end cells plus the routes: one esbuild bundle,
// then a `tsc` pass per project for the self-test and a second per project for
// the matrix, all with skipLibCheck over symlinked node_modules.
// Routes are most of the added time, and about a third of it is the
// archetype-independence re-check (495 extra generations, no compiles).
//
// NO NETWORK, which is the property that keeps this in the REQUIRED CI job. The
// route typings are devDependencies rather than a throwaway `npm install`
// precisely for that: the required job already runs `pnpm install
// --frozen-lockfile` behind a pnpm cache, so the packages are amortised to
// nothing, whereas an uncached install inside a blocking check is a flake
// waiting to happen (measuring this, `npm install ai` failed outright with
// ETARGET on a transitive @ai-sdk/provider pin).
//
// If routes ever push this past ~60s, do NOT quietly narrow the matrix: subset
// it deterministically and PRINT the subset, so a shrinking gate is visible in
// the log instead of being discovered later.
//
// It runs in `.github/workflows/test.yml` after the build (it reads the SHIPPED
// dist/*.d.ts). It is deliberately NOT in `npm test`: it needs `dist/`, and
// vitest does not build.
//
//   npm run verify:scaffold                  # from packages/ui
//   node scripts/verify-scaffold-compiles.mjs [--keep] [--filter <substring>]
//
// `--keep` leaves the temp directory in place and prints its path.
// `--filter agentic` narrows the matrix while iterating.

 *      The renderer could produce them; the gate could not ask for them, because

/**
 * The generative-UI card ROUND TRIP, which tsc cannot judge either.
 *
 * Cards are three pieces that only work together — a `createCardRegistry` the app
 * declares, `cardTools()` that turns it into the tool definitions the model is
 * offered, and `cardFromToolCall()` in the loop that turns the model's answer back
 * into an envelope — and any TWO of them compile perfectly while the third being
 * absent means no card ever reaches the screen. There is no type relating them.
 * That is the same class as `solidPartCoverageCheck`: valid code, missing
 * behaviour, invisible to the compiler.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS DERIVED FROM, AND WHY THAT MATTERS
 * --------------------------------------------
 * The expectation per cell comes from the scaffolder's own `cardEmitPlan`, over
 * the full SURFACES x INTEGRATIONS x FRAMEWORKS product. No count is written
 * down here: "the agentic archetype, 8 integrations, 8 frameworks = 64" would go
 * stale the day cards move or an integration lands, and would pass while doing so.
 * The realistic defect this catches is one of the EIGHT framework renderers not
 * following the decision — they are eight separate hand-written emitters.
 *
 * A plan-driven check alone would be circular (a wrong plan and a wrong emitter
 * agree), so there are two assertions that consult NO plan:
 *
 *   · every scaffold that declares a `tools` array must also call `cardTools`.
 *     A tools array handed to a model with no card tool in it is the silent hole:
 *     the model is never told a card exists, so it never emits one, and nothing
 *     anywhere says why. This is what fails when a new integration forwards tools
 *     without declaring a `clientToolFormat`.
 *   · at least one cell must expect cards and at least one must not. A predicate
 *     stuck at `false` would make every other assertion here vacuously true, which
 *     is precisely the shape of check this repo keeps shipping.
 *
 * NOT sliced at a delimiter and half-checked. `frontEnd()` cuts block (2) off, and
 * that cut is why 65 of 77 routes went uncompiled for months, so the negative
 * assertion below runs over the WHOLE scaffold text: card code appearing under the
 * BACKEND ROUTE heading of an archetype that should have none would be caught, not
 * sliced away.

/**
 * Every RELATIVE import an emitted route writes must carry an explicit extension.
 *
 * This is TS2835. The route-node project now runs under genuine nodenext and so
 * DOES flag it in live code — but this textual pass is not redundant, and it is
 * kept deliberately, because it covers two things tsc structurally cannot:
 *
 *   1. COMMENTED-OUT code. The vite.config.ts chunk is emitted entirely as `//`
 *      guidance a consumer uncomments, and splitRouteFiles drops it before tsc
 *      ever runs (see the call site). tsc does not parse comments. That chunk is
 *      exactly where the shipped defect was.
 *   2. route-web and route-worker, which stay on `bundler` ON PURPOSE — Next,
 *      SvelteKit, TanStack Start and wrangler all ship bundler resolution — so a
 *      missing extension in one of their routes is invisible to the compiler
 *      there, and this is its only coverage.
 *
 * So the compiled check and this one overlap on 18 live route-node imports and
 * are disjoint everywhere else. Keep both.
 *
 * Measured in a stock `npm create vite -- --template react-ts` app:
 *   vite.config.ts(1,31): error TS2835: Relative import paths need explicit file
 *   extensions in ECMAScript imports when '--moduleResolution' is 'node16' or
 *   'nodenext'. Did you mean './vite-chat-api.js'?
 *
 * `.js` is the required form even though the file on disk is `.ts` — that is the
 * TypeScript convention nodenext expects, and Vite's own config loader resolves
 * it. Verified: `npm run build` passes and `POST /api/chat` answers 401 from the
 * provider (not 404), so the plugin really loaded.
 *
 * Commented lines count. The vite.config.ts chunk is emitted entirely commented
 * out as guidance a consumer uncomments, so an extensionless import there fails
 * their build just the same — and that is exactly where the shipped defect was.

 *

 * both tags, stage a file, draw the chip — and then submit a message with no
 * `file` part on it, at which point the user watches their attachment vanish.
 * That is what every scaffold in this repo did before this capability existed
 * (`kai-submit` carries `{ value, attachments }` and every emitted handler read
 * only `.value`), so it is not a hypothetical.
 *
 * Derived from the scaffolder's own `attachmentEmitPlan`, never from a count or a
 * preset name — see `cardRoundTripCheck` for why that matters here too. The
 * anti-vacuity pair at the bottom is the same guard: a plan stuck at one value
 * makes every assertion above it vacuously true.
