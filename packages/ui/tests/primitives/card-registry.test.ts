// tests/primitives/card-registry.test.ts
// The registry exposes every built-in card type for both layers, and merges overrides.
//
// TYPES IS DERIVED, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE.
// It used to be a literal array here, which made both coverage assertions circular in
// the only direction that matters: `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` and `BUILTIN_CARD_COMPONENTS`
// are hand-parallel to `cardSchemas` and to each other, and the list they were checked
// against was a third hand-written copy. Measured before the change: adding an eighth
// type to `cardSchemas` left this whole file green — `mergeCardComponents(undefined)`
// still had seven entries and the length assertion below still said 7 — while the new
// card had no component at all. `<CardRenderer>` falls through to nothing for a type
// with no entry, so that card renders as an empty slot.
//
// Neither map can be DERIVED. `link` -> `kai-link-preview` is not `kai-<type>` (the
// header of src/primitives/card-tags.ts records that the MCP re-derived it by
// convention and got away with it only because no eighth type existed), and the
// component map is JSX wiring, not data. So the fix is not a derivation, it is
// checking them for completeness against the list that IS derived.
//
// `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` also has a second, independent guard:
// mcp/mcp/reference.test.ts walks `cardSchemaNames` through
// `cardTagForType` and requires each to resolve to a REGISTERED element, which the
// eighth type failed. Nothing covered `BUILTIN_CARD_COMPONENTS` at all.
