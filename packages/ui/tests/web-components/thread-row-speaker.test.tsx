/**
 * The message row must name its speaker THROUGH THE ELEMENT — `<kai-thread>` and
 * `<kai-chat>`, populated, which is the only path a consumer has.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, which is the part worth keeping: `Message` gained
 * `role="article"` + a speaker `aria-label` in c80080e, and that fix was verified
 * on `Message` in ISOLATION — rendered directly, role asserted, axe clean.
 * Neither `Thread` nor `ChatThread` passed `role` when rendering the list, so the
 * a11y fix reached nobody through the primary path and the isolated tests stayed
 * green the whole time. Verifying a mechanism is not verifying the thing that
 * uses it. Every assertion below therefore goes through a real custom element
 * with messages on it; none of them constructs a `<Message>`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT DO. jsdom has no accessibility tree, so these assert the
 * ATTRIBUTES that produce the accessible role and name, not the computed values
 * themselves. The computed AX role/name is measured in a real chromium by
 * `scripts/probe-thread-row-semantics.mjs` (CDP Accessibility.getFullAXTree),
 * which is where the claim "AX role article, AX name User message" is actually
 * established — with the fix reverted it reads role "none", name "",
 * ignored=true ("uninteresting") on all six rows. Keep the two together: this
 * file is the cheap CI guard, that script is the evidence.
 *
 * NOT GUARDED BY AXE, deliberately. Axe has no rule for "a message row ought to
 * name its speaker"; it judges a role that is present and wrong, never a missing
 * one. Measured, not assumed: with the fix reverted, aria-roles /
 * aria-allowed-role / aria-prohibited-attr / aria-valid-attr-value all report 0
 * violations over a fully unlabelled thread. An axe assertion here would have
 * been a check that proves nothing.
