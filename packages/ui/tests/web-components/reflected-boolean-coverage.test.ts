/**
 * GUARD — every property→attribute boolean reflection in `src/web-components` must go
 * through `reflectFlag`, or be a NAMED exemption with a reason.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The read-back defect
 * (`tests/web-components/reflected-boolean-readback.test.tsx`, findings G-05) was not one
 * bug. It was one PATTERN — `createEffect(() => element.toggleAttribute(x, flag(x)))` —
 * copied into four places, in three of which nobody noticed it made the property
 * unreadable, while the fourth (`kai-switch`) had quietly carried a correct version
 * the whole time and nobody generalised it. Fixing the four sites without a guard
 * would leave the copyable shape in the tree and the next facade would copy it again;
 * `resizable.tsx`'s own comment saying it was following "the `collapsed`/`loading`
 * precedent" is what that looks like in practice.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED. The site list is SCANNED, never written down: every non-test
 * source file under `src/web-components` is read and its real `.toggleAttribute(` calls are
 * found with comments stripped, so a new facade is covered the day it is added. Only
 * the EXEMPTIONS are written down, each with a reason — the point being that a
 * deliberate exception and an oversight look different in the diff.
 *
 * WATCH IT FAIL. `detects a planted violation` runs the same analyzer over a facade
 * written the old way and requires a finding. Without it this file could pass by
 * scanning nothing, which is the failure mode it is most exposed to (a wrong glob
 * finds zero files and every assertion below holds vacuously).

 *
 * The comment stripping is CHEAP FUTURE-PROOFING, not a present necessity, and the

 * tempting one to write. Measured against the tree as it stands, a raw
 * `/\.toggleAttribute\s*\(/` finds hits in exactly two files, `define.tsx` and
 * `switch.tsx` — both already exempt — so stripping changes no verdict today. The
 * prose this fix left behind at the repaired sites names `reflectFlag` or
 * `toggleAttribute` bare, without the `.` and `(` the regex needs, so it is not
 * matched either way. What stripping buys is that the next person explaining a fix in
 * a comment (`// replaces element.toggleAttribute('x', y)`) does not get flagged for
 * describing the correct code — an easy accident, and one that would train people to
 * add exemptions to silence a false positive. The behaviour is pinned by its own
 * fixture test below rather than by the real tree, since the real tree cannot
 * currently exercise it. Strings are tracked only well enough to keep a `//` inside
 * one from eating the rest of a line.
