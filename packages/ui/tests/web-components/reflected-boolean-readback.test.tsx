/**
 * GUARD — a boolean prop a facade REFLECTS to a host attribute must read back what
 * was set.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. A facade reflects a flag with
 * `createEffect(() => element.toggleAttribute('loading', flag('loading')))`.
 * `toggleAttribute(name, true)` sets the attribute to the EMPTY STRING, which fires
 * component-register's `attributeChangedCallback`, which writes the prop back as
 * `this[name] = parseAttributeValue("")` — and `parseAttributeValue` is `if (!value)
 * return;`, i.e. `undefined` for the empty string. So:
 *
 *   el.loading = true;   // …a tick later…
 *   el.loading            // → undefined, while el.hasAttribute('loading') is true
 *
 * The element still BEHAVES correctly the whole time, because `flag()` falls back to
 * attribute presence — which is exactly why the bug is silent, and why it cost a
 * downstream builder a debugging cycle (docs/superpowers/research/
 * 2026-08-19-rung-1-mcp-rebuild/findings.md, G-05). The property is effectively
 * write-only: you can set it, you can never read it.
 *
 * It is asymmetric, so both directions are asserted. Setting `false` REMOVES the
 * attribute, and the callback's `if (newVal == null && !this[name]) return;` guard
 * fires because the prop is already falsy — no write-back, prop stays `false`. So a
 * test that only ever checked the `false` case would pass against the broken code.
 *
 * WATCH IT FAIL. Every read-back case here was confirmed RED before the fix, with
 * `undefined` as the received value — not merely absent, which is the failure mode
 * where a guard passes because it never ran. `kai-switch` is the control: it has
 * carried a hand-rolled version of the fix since long before this file, so it was
 * GREEN in the same run, proving the harness can distinguish the two.
