/**
 * The `label` prop must not override text the user can SEE.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `<kai-button>`'s `label` was documented as "ignored when
 * you slot visible text" while the facade emitted `aria-label` unconditionally,
 * so `<kai-button label="Submit">Save</kai-button>` presented a button reading
 * "Save" that answered only to "Submit". `aria-label` REPLACES the computed
 * accessible name rather than adding to it, which is a WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in
 * Name) failure — and speech-input users are the ones it breaks, because they
 * say the word they can see and nothing responds.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT DO. jsdom has no accessibility tree, so every assertion
 * below checks the `aria-label` ATTRIBUTE — the input to the name computation,
 * never the computed name. The computed names are measured in a real chromium by
 * `scripts/probe-button-accessible-name.mjs` (CDP Accessibility.getFullAXTree),
 * which is where "slotted text names the button on its own" is actually
 * established: it reads AX name "Save" sourced from `contents`, with no
 * aria-label present. Keep the two together — this file is the cheap CI guard,
 * that script is the evidence.
 *
 * THE GUARD ON THE GUARD. Half these cases assert `aria-label` IS emitted. A fix
 * that suppresses it too eagerly leaves icon-only buttons NAMELESS, which is a
 * worse defect than the one being fixed, and every one of those cases is green
 * on the ORIGINAL unfixed code — so they cannot be what makes this file pass.
 * The rows that fail before the fix are the three marked `wins:` below.
