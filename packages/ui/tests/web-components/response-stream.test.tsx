/**
 * `<kai-response-stream>` — the typewriter/fade text-reveal element.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until it, kai-response-stream was on the coverage guard's
 * punch list as `kind: 'nothing'`, with the guard's own note calling it "the worst
 * place in this list for a gap given the kit streams by default". Nothing had ever
 * asserted the reveal happens, the modes differ, the AsyncIterable property path
 * works, or `kai-complete` fires — and `kai-complete` is the consumer's only
 * signal that the reveal is done (enable the input, scroll to bottom, …).
 *
 * CONVENTIONS FOLLOWED (tool.test.tsx, #296's backfill): real registered element;
 * `text` accepts an AsyncIterable, which cannot be written in markup, so
 * markup-then-assign is driven alongside the property path; negative assertions
 * are paired with positives over the same harness. Timing is polled against real
 * timers because the reveal IS timer-driven — each poll has a hard deadline, so a
 * hang fails rather than wedging the suite.
