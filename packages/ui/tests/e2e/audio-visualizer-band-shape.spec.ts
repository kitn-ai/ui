/**
 * Regression guard: speaking tiles render a centre-outward symmetric
 * profile, not the old left-to-right descending ramp.
 *
 * `<AudioVisualizer>` gained a centre-outward mirror for real-audio bands in
 * commit 3f34a45 (`mirrorBandsCenterOut` / `mirrorBandsAroundRing` in
 * `primitives/audio-bands.ts`). `index.tsx`'s `bands()` accessor
 * short-circuits that mirror whenever a caller supplies `props.bands`
 * directly (`if (props.bands) return props.bands;`), and every `speaking`
 * tile in `audio-visualizer.stories.tsx` drives the demo through exactly
 * that prop -- so a first pass of the stories (`useVoiceBands` for
 * Bar/Grid/Radial/Custom, `useFakeBands` for StateMatrix) still showed the
 * OLD ramp, not the new centre-outward shape, despite the component itself
 * being fixed. A follow-up fixed the STORIES to pre-mirror `ceil(n/2)` bands
 * through the same primitives the live-audio path uses before handing them
 * to `bands`, which is what this file verifies actually landed.
 *
 * Provenance (do not re-derive lightly): every hard assertion below --
 * `SYMMETRY_TOLERANCE`, centre-strictly-max for the linear variants, and the
 * per-element (never aggregated) sampling methodology -- was watched FAIL
 * against the pre-fix stories (left-heavy ramps, deviations 0.12-0.71,
 * centre never the max) before it was watched PASS against the fixed
 * stories. That RED-then-GREEN cycle is what makes this guard trustworthy;
 * loosening a threshold here should be treated as re-opening that
 * provenance, not a routine tweak.
 *
 * Sampling is per ELEMENT, never aggregated into one string across a whole
 * row (see the HANDOFF doc's section 5: a previous session joined 120 radial
 * spokes into one string, saw one distinct value, and drew a wrong
 * conclusion). Each tile's evidence file records the raw per-index
 * time-averaged profile.
 *
 * The StateMatrix story (and its 3 tests here: bar/grid/radial against a
 * SYNTHETIC feed) was deleted from `audio-visualizer.stories.tsx` -- it
 * duplicated the per-variant stories, which already render every state.
 * Removed here to match: the surviving Bar/Grid/Radial/Custom tests already
 * prove the same centre-outward mirror contract against the REAL voice
 * fixture, which is the stronger of the two coverages. Every remaining
 * assertion and threshold below is untouched by that removal.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:audio-visualizer-band-shape`
 *
 * A worktree's run must not attach to the MAIN checkout's Storybook on 6006.
 * Set `KAI_SB_PORT` (for example `KAI_SB_PORT=6018`) and every Storybook suite
 * moves with it; the config starts a server on that port itself if nothing is
 * listening. See the `KAI_SB_PORT` comment at the top of
 * `config/playwright/storybook.config.ts` for exactly why.

 * (still exact) or the centre needing to be BELOW its neighbours (which
 * would be the actual regression this guard exists to catch). Every other
 * tile keeps the strict `slack: 0` default deliberately: Bar and Custom
 * read a continuous level (no saturation risk at any gain) -- passed the
 * strict check cleanly 3/3 runs, so amending them would be loosening a
 * check that was never broken. (The StateMatrix bar/grid/radial tests that
