/**
 * ★ REFUSE TO RUN AGAINST A STALE BUNDLE.
 *
 * The hover-card fixture imports `/dist/kai.es.js`, which is the entire point of
 * the suite: it drives the artifact a consumer installs rather than the tree CI
 * compiles. That same fact is its failure mode. Run it without rebuilding and
 * every test passes — against yesterday's code. Not hypothetical: a deliberately
 * broken fix produced a GREEN run during verification until the bundle was
 * rebuilt. A suite that silently measures the wrong artifact is worse than no
 * suite; it is a check that proves nothing while looking like proof.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS FILE HAS ALREADY SHIPPED TWICE ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Both versions before this one compared mtimes over the WRONG POPULATION, and
 * the second only narrowed the window rather than closing it:
 *
 *   v1  newest-under-`src/`  vs  `dist/kai.es.js`
 *       False-positived on a freshly built tree, because `web-component-types.d.ts` is
 *       generated into `src/` by `build:api` in POSTbuild — after the bundle.
 *
 *   v2  newest-under-`src/`  vs  newest-under-`dist/`
 *       Same bug, smaller window. It assumed `dist/` is always written last.
 *       That is not guaranteed, it merely held locally — and it broke a required
 *       CI job on an unrelated PR with
 *       `web-component-types.d.ts is 0s newer than dist/llms/llms-full.txt`.
 *       ZERO SECONDS: same-second writes, decided by scheduling.
 *
 * The mistake both times was counting build OUTPUTS that happen to live under
 * `src/` as if they were INPUTS. A regenerated output being newer than the
 * bundle says nothing about staleness. Timestamp ordering was never the fix;
 * the population was.
 *
 * ── THE EXCLUSION IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `scripts/verify-generated-sync.mjs` already owns the authoritative record of
 * "checked-in files DERIVED from src/web-components" — that guard exists to prove each
 * one still matches its generator. Its `GENERATED` array is read here, so adding
 * a generator updates both guards at once. A private second list in this file is
 * the exact "derive it, don't type it" failure this repo keeps paying for, and
 * it would rot the day someone adds a generator.
 *
 * It is READ rather than imported because that script is a CLI: it runs the
 * guard and calls `process.exit` at module scope, so importing it would execute
 * it. The read is a real parse (the TypeScript AST, the same approach
 * `gen-web-component-api.mjs` uses on `slots.ts`) and not a regex, so a change to the
 * record's shape fails loudly here instead of silently matching nothing.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* EXCLUDED ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/web-components/compiled.css` and `src/primitives/card-validate-schemas.ts` are
 * generated too, and they STAY in the population on purpose. Both are written by
 * `prebuild`, and both are compiled INTO the bundle — `compiled.css` is imported
 * as `./compiled.css?inline`. If either is newer than the bundle, the bundle
 * really is stale and firing is correct. "Generated" is not the test; "is it an
 * input to the artifact under test" is, and the `GENERATED` record happens to
 * name exactly the postbuild outputs that are not.
 *
 * One of those, `web-component-manifest.json`, is both generated AND imported (by
 * `autoloader.ts`), so excluding it does lose a theoretical signal: a HAND EDIT
 * to it would not be caught here. That is the right trade — it is a generated
 * file, hand-editing it is not a supported operation, and
 * `verify-generated-sync` catches exactly that case by comparing content.
 *
 * ── WHY MTIME AT ALL, GIVEN ORDERING IS NOT GUARANTEED ───────────────────────
 *
 * A content-derived check is better where the artifact's structure is derivable
 * from its source, which is why the CSS guard compares structure instead of
 * timestamps: tokens in, utilities out. `dist/kai.es.js` has no such cheap
 * correspondence — it is bundled, tree-shaken and minified, so proving it
 * matches `src/` means hashing the input set and recording that hash AT BUILD
 * TIME. Nothing records one, adding it means changing the build, and it would
 * create a second source of truth about what went into the bundle.
 *
 * With the population corrected, ordering is no longer load-bearing: every
 * remaining file is a build INPUT, and an input is by definition read before the
 * output is written. The comparison is back to `dist/kai.es.js` specifically —
 * the file the fixture actually loads — rather than the newest of `dist/`, which
 * was only ever a workaround for the population bug and would mask a bundle
 * written early in a build that a later edit invalidated.
