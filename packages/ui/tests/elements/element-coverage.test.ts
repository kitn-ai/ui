/**
 * GUARD — every `kai-*` element in the manifest is exercised by SOME test, or is a
 * NAMED exemption carrying a reason that says what is missing.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A coverage audit of the 79 manifest tags found elements with
 * no automated exercise of any kind — `kai-dialog`, `kai-scope-picker`,
 * `kai-response-stream`, `kai-segmented`, `kai-setting-item` among them — and the
 * reason nobody noticed is that the obvious check for "is this element tested?" is a
 * grep for its tag, and a grep OVERCOUNTS every time. The tag appears in
 * `src/elements/slots.test.ts` registry fixtures, in a `tests/react` prop table as a
 * string beside a React wrapper (`['kai-scope-picker', () => <ScopePicker />]`), in a
 * type-only declaration, in a doc comment, and in `payload-boundary.test.ts` as an
 * inert host with no assertion about the host at all. MOST of the elements this guard
 * flags do appear in a test file by name. Not one of them is tested.
 *
 * So the analyzer never trusts a tag's TEXT. Coverage is one of:
 *
 *   (a) a test file IMPORTS the element's facade module — resolved through the real
 *       filesystem from the manifest's own tag→module mapping, so a rename cannot
 *       leave a string behind that still matches — or CONSTRUCTS the element, which
 *       means literally `document.createElement('kai-x')` or JSX `<kai-x>`. A tag
 *       inside an array, a `querySelector`, a template literal compiled by tsc, or a
 *       comment is not construction and does not count.
 *
 *   (b) a test file imports the SOLID COMPONENT the facade renders. That list is
 *       parsed out of the facade's own import lines (below), never written down here.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS WRITTEN DOWN. The tag list is the manifest, the same
 * source `src/elements/element-registry.test.ts` partitions. The facade module per
 * tag is the manifest's own mapping. The Solid component per facade is parsed from
 * the facade. The test corpus is walked. The ONLY hand-written thing is EXEMPT — and
 * every entry in it is a punch-list item, not a decision to leave something untested.
 *
 * WATCH IT FAIL. Three ways, all exercised below over fixtures rather than by
 * damaging the tree: the analyzer must REJECT the fixture-noise shapes
 * (`rejects tag mentions that are not construction`), must ACCEPT the real ones
 * (`accepts real construction`), and a stale exemption — an exemption for a tag that
 * has since been covered — is its own failing test rather than a silent pass. The
 * scan being non-vacuous is asserted first, because a wrong glob finds zero test
 * files and then EVERY element looks uncovered, which fails loudly, while a wrong
 * manifest path finds zero tags and makes every assertion below pass while checking
 * nothing.
 *
 * THOSE CHECKS ALREADY EARNED THEIR KEEP, twice, on the first run of this file:
 *   • the analyzer counted `<kai-dialog>` inside a COMMENT as construction, so it
 *     reported an untested element as tested — the very mistake it was written to
 *     stop. Hence `stripNonCode`. Fixing it exposed a NINETEENTH uncovered element,
 *     `kai-empty`, whose only test-file hits are a doc comment and a fixture string.
 *   • the guard scanned ITSELF, and its deliberately construction-shaped fixtures
 *     credited three of the elements it exempts. The stale-exemption test is what
 *     named them. A guard's own fixtures are not coverage.

 * Blank the two syntaxes where a tag is TEXT rather than code — comments and regex

 * COMMENTS, because prose is where tags get MENTIONED: `// <kai-dialog> traps Tab,
 * this must not` sits in a neighbouring suite today and would otherwise be credited
 * as construction of kai-dialog — the exact overcounting this guard exists to reject,
 * committed by the guard itself.
 *
 * REGEX LITERALS, for the same reason and at a higher cost. `kai-tool` — a core
 * agentic element rendering model-controlled arguments — was reported COVERED for
 * months on the strength of `scaffold.test.ts` asserting the scaffolder does NOT emit
 * it: `expect(text).not.toMatch(/<kai-tool><\/kai-tool>/)`. A tag inside a regex
 * literal, in a NEGATIVE assertion, credited as construction. It never reached the
 * punch list, so it was not even a known gap. Comments were the syntax someone
 * thought of; this is the one they did not.
 *
 * STRINGS come back TWO WAYS, because the two construction shapes want opposite
 * treatments and asking one question of one text is what let the second hole through.
 * `createElement('kai-x')` IS a string literal, so `code` keeps string contents. JSX
 * is code and can NEVER be inside a string, so `codeNoStrings` blanks them — which is
 * what stops a test NAME (`it('… does NOT emit bare <kai-tool> …')`) from counting as
 * a `<kai-tool>` element. `reflected-boolean-coverage.test.ts` splits its own scans
 * the same way and for the same reason. Both views come out of ONE traversal: the
 * scanner already knows where the strings are, and stripping the corpus twice was
 * measurable.
 *
 * Comments go first. Doing it the other way round lets an apostrophe in prose
 * (`// don't do this`) open a string state that swallows real code after it.
