/**
 * Drift guard: the Playwright e2e/IVP specs load Storybook stories by id
 * (`?id=<story>`). Those stories are TEST FIXTURES — if one is deleted or
 * retitled (e.g. during a Storybook reshuffle), the spec silently 404s. This
 * test fails loudly instead: it cross-checks every story id the specs
 * reference against the FULL ids (section + story name) actually declared
 * by the story files.
 *
 * If this fails, either (a) restore/retitle the fixture, or (b) update the
 * spec to point at the new story id. The web-component fixtures live under
 * the "Test Fixtures/…" section (see .storybook/preview.ts storySort).
 *
 * WHY FULL IDS, NOT JUST THE SECTION (the bug this guard used to have): the
 * previous version only compared the SECTION prefix (the part before the
 * first `--`, e.g. "components-audiovisualizer") against declared
 * story TITLES, and never looked at the story NAME after `--` at all. A
 * section stays "declared" as long as ANY story in it survives, so deleting
 * one story out of several sharing a section (the StateMatrix story was
 * removed from `audio-visualizer.stories.tsx` while Bar/Grid/Radial/Custom
 * stayed) left three e2e tests pointed at a 404 with this guard still green
 * — the exact "check that proves nothing" failure mode this epic keeps
 * hitting. Fixed by validating the SUFFIX too, against the real set of
 * `export const Name: Story` declarations per file, not just its title.
 *
 * WHY NOT A LOOSE SUBSTRING MATCH (the guard's own earlier trap): an
 * earlier version's extraction regex matched ANY `word--word`-shaped
 * substring anywhere in a spec file's source, including inside an unrelated
 * absolute filesystem path that happened to contain a double-dash — a false
 * positive that briefly broke this guard for reasons that had nothing to do
 * with a story reference. This version anchors extraction to the literal
 * `?id=` query-parameter marker every genuine story reference in this
 * codebase actually uses (confirmed by grepping every tests/e2e/*.spec.ts
 * file's construction of story URLs before writing this), which a random
 * path essentially cannot contain.
 *
 * WHY DYNAMIC/PARAMETERIZED REFERENCES DON'T FALSE-FAIL: some specs build a
 * story id from a variable rather than a single literal (checked by
 * grepping every `?id=`/`STORY(...)`/`story(...)` construction in
 * tests/e2e/*.spec.ts before choosing this strategy — see the two shapes
 * below). Both are resolved to concrete ids and validated exactly, the same
 * as a literal; only a reference this file genuinely cannot resolve falls
 * back to a weaker section-only check (never silently skipped, and never a
 * hard requirement it satisfies by accident):
 *   1. A factory function `const NAME = (id: string) => \`...${id}...\``
 *      (this repo's `STORY`/`story` helpers) — every call site `NAME('lit')`
 *      is resolved by substitution.
 *   2. A literal-prefixed dynamic suffix used directly, `section--${var}`,
 *      where `var` is a `for (const var of [...])` loop variable over an
 *      inline (or previously `const`-declared) literal array — every loop
 *      value is resolved by substitution.

 * suffix is `Name`'s kebab form.
 *
 * The `: Story` type annotation requirement is deliberate, not a guess:
 * checked first (see the amendment-round report) that every single story
 * export across this whole tree (409 of them) uses that exact annotation,

 *
 * The title match itself needs a filter, not just the first `title:` found
 * — caught by this guard's own first draft failing for the wrong reason
 * (see the report): `chat-slots.stories.tsx` has a `title: 'Q3 forecast'`
 * inside an unrelated mock-data fixture BEFORE the real
 * `title: 'Labs/Chat Slots'` meta block, and a naive first-match took the
 * mock data's title as the section. Storybook's own convention (verified
 * against every meta title in this tree: 100% contain one, zero
 * counter-examples) is a `/`-delimited hierarchical path — "Labs/Chat
 * Slots", "Components/AudioVisualizer" — which a plain string
 * fixture essentially never is. Requiring a `/` in the matched value is
 * what tells the two apart.
