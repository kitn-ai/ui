/**
 * GUARD — a TypeScript backend must be able to NAME a card payload.
 *
 * We publish `./schemas/*.json` so a Python or Go route can generate models for the
 * card payloads. For a long time TypeScript, the language this kit is authored in,
 * was the one that could not do the same: `ConfirmCardData` and friends were
 * declared inside their components' `.tsx`, and a type import still has to RESOLVE
 * even though it erases, so naming one from a Node/no-DOM project was
 *
 *   TS6142: Module '../../components/choice-card' was resolved to
 *           '.../src/components/choice-card/choice-card.tsx', but '--jsx' is not set.
 *
 * and `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` could not re-export them at all without pulling the
 * Solid tree into the server-safe entry's graph. A route building a card envelope
 * got `data: unknown`.
 *
 * That was the FOURTH instance of one defect (after `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS`,
 * `CardComponentMap` and the tag map), and each of the first three was fixed and
 * then left with no check, which is why there was a fourth. This is the check.
 * `src/primitives/card-data-types.ts` is where the payload types live now, and the
 * property that matters about it is not "it compiles" but "it compiles WITHOUT
 * `jsx`", which every other pass in `nx typecheck ui` is too permissive to see:
 * tsconfig.json, tsconfig.tests.json and both react configs all set a `jsx`, and
 * tsconfig.mcp.json (which does not) includes only `mcp/mcp/**`, so
 * nothing there imports these types and nothing would notice them moving back.
 *
 * WATCHED IN THE DISCRIMINATING DIRECTION. Test 2 points the identical probe at a
 * `.tsx` and requires TS6142 to come back. Without it this file would keep passing
 * if the compiler options silently gained a `jsx` (which is exactly how a check
 * like this rots into proving nothing) — and relaxing them is not the alternative
 * anyway: granting the MCP pass `jsx` was measured at 130 errors on this case.
 *
 * It builds its own `ts.Program` rather than shelling out to `tsc -p
 * tsconfig.mcp.json`, because that project's `include` names only the MCP tree; a
 * probe would have to be written INTO src/ and deleted again, which races the
 * editor and leaves debris on a crashed run. The options below are copied from
 * tsconfig.mcp.json and asserted against it in test 3, so the copy cannot drift.
