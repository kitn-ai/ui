/**
 * GUARD: the shipped shadow sheet is compiled from an EXPLICIT `@source` list.
 *
 * `src/elements/styles.css` imports Tailwind with `source(none)` and names the
 * directories whose class strings ship in dist/. That is what keeps story-only,
 * test-only and scaffold-template classes (257 of them, ~2 KB gzip) out of every
 * consumer's shadow root. The cost of an explicit list is that a new directory
 * under src/ that starts shipping class strings, or a file the excludes catch
 * by accident, compiles to a component whose classes are silently missing from
 * `compiled.css`: the JS ships the class, the sheet has no rule, the element
 * renders unstyled in exactly one spot, and nothing in the build notices.
 *
 * So this derives the truth from the other side. The oxide scanner (the same
 * extractor Tailwind runs over `@source` paths) is pointed at the shipped
 * SOURCE, selected by the OPPOSITE rule to the one styles.css uses: everything
 * under src/ except the directories that are known not to ship class strings
 * for rendering (test-utils and the docs stories) and the test/story files.
 * styles.css lists what IS shipped; this
 * lists what is NOT, so a new directory that starts shipping class strings is
 * scanned here and missed there, and that is the failure. Every candidate the
 * design system can generate a rule for must then have its selector in
 * `compiled.css`. The sheet is read, not recompiled: `compiled.css` is the
 * artifact `src/elements/css.ts` injects into every shadow root, so it is the
 * thing that ships and the thing that has to be right.
 *
 * WHY NOT dist/. It was tried first. dist/index.js bundles tailwind-merge, whose
 * default config enumerates the entire utility vocabulary as string literals
 * (`antialiased`, `backdrop-sepia`, `table-column-group`, 63 generable names in
 * all), so scanning the bundle reports every one of them as "used and missing".
 * A waiver derived from tailwind-merge's config would also hide a real drop of
 * any class in that vocabulary. The source tree has no such noise.
 *
 * Vacuity guards: the candidate count has a floor, the generable set has a
 * floor, and a control asserts a class that exists only in a story
 * (`from-fuchsia-500`) is ABSENT, so the assertion cannot pass on a sheet that
 * simply contains everything.

 * (comments included) and compiles rules for what it finds, which is why src/elements/styles.css
 * carries the matching `@source not "../utils/cn-merge.ts"`. Scanning it here anyway would
 * report every one of those tokens as "used and missing from compiled.css" and fail on a sheet
 * that is CORRECT — the same false positive, from the opposite side. The two exclusions must
 * move together: drop this one and this test goes red naming 33 tokens (loudly, which is the
 * point); drop the @source line and this test still passes while every consumer pays for the
 * rules (which is why the pair is written down in both files).
