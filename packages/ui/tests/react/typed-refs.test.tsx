/**
 * F-9 (blocks contract spike): a forwarded ref must hand back the ELEMENT
 * INTERFACE, not a bare HTMLElement. The interfaces exist and ship
 * (dist/web-components.d.ts, one Kai*Element per tag, methods included); the wrapper
 * generator simply did not use them, so `#ref` promised a typed handle the
 * react form could not honour and every ref site needed a cast.
 *
 * THE CALLBACK FORM IS THE TEST, AND THAT IS NOT AN AESTHETIC CHOICE.
 * `useRef<KaiViewStackElement>(null)` gives `RefObject<KaiViewStackElement | null>`,
 * and `RefObject`'s `current` is a MUTABLE property, which TypeScript checks
 * covariantly -- so that object IS assignable to `Ref<HTMLElement>` and the
 * object form compiles clean even against the broken wrapper. Measured: it
 * produces no error on main. The hole is only visible where the element flows
 * the OTHER way, into a callback parameter, which is the form the spike's react
 * tree uses at report lines 960 and 986 because that is what `#ref` compiles to.
 * A test written the object way would have passed on both sides of this fix.
 *
 * Both halves are asserted, because each catches what the other misses:
 *   - COMPILE TIME, under `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.react.test.json`.
 *   - RUNTIME, under `npm run test:react`, where the ref really receives the
 *     upgraded custom element from the prebuilt bundle.
