/**
 * GUARD — house style over the descriptions the generators RENDER.
 *
 * `web-component-meta.json` is the single model every documentation artifact is built
 * from: `llms-full.txt`, `docs/web-components.md`, `src/web-components/web-component-types.d.ts`
 * (so a consumer's editor tooltip) and the `kai` MCP's `component_reference`. A
 * sentence written in a facade is therefore read by consumers and by coding agents
 * in four places at once, and a style slip propagates to all four on the next build.
 *
 * TWO RULES ARE ENFORCED HERE
 * ---------------------------
 * 1. NO EM DASHES. `apps/docs/STYLE.md` lists the "em-dash flourish" among the
 *    tells that make copy read as AI-generated. 122 rendered descriptions carried
 *    one; they were rewritten (a full stop, a comma, or a colon, whichever the
 *    sentence actually wanted) rather than having the punctuation deleted.
 *
 * 2. DELIBERATELY MIRRORED DESCRIPTIONS STAY IDENTICAL. A handful of members are
 *    declared on several elements and documented with the SAME words on purpose,
 *    so `<kai-chat>` and `<kai-message>` cannot drift into describing one concept
 *    two ways. That identity is invisible in a diff: a sweep that rewrites three
 *    of four copies leaves the fourth silently out of step, and each file looks
 *    fine on its own. See MIRRORED below.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A CHECK THAT PROVES NOTHING
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Nothing here restates a number that could drift into agreement with a broken
 * model. The description set is read off `web-component-meta.json`, the offender list is
 * derived, and the mirrored GROUPS are derived too (membership is "every element
 * the model says declares this member", never a hand-listed tag list). The floors
 * exist for the opposite reason: every assertion below loops over the model, so a
 * model that collapsed to two web components would make the whole file pass while
 * covering nothing. The floors are what stop that.
