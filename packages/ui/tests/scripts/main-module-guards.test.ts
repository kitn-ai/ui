/**
 * Every "am I the entry point?" guard in this REPO must still be TRUE when the
 * checkout sits on a path that percent-encodes.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR IS SILENT, WHICH IS WHY IT IS A TEST AND NOT A NOTE.
 * `import.meta.url` is a URL and percent-encodes; `process.argv[1]` is a path and
 * does not. A guard hand-built as `` import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}` ``
 * therefore compares `file:///My%20Repo/x.mjs` against `file:///My Repo/x.mjs` and is
 * false — so the guarded body never runs, the script exits 0, and nothing is printed.
 * Measured on `packages/ui` copied under `/private/tmp/kitn spaced repro`, three
 * scripts deep:
 *
 *   node scripts/gen-card-validation-schemas.mjs --check   -> exit 0, no output,
 *       with card-validate-schemas.ts DELIBERATELY CORRUPTED. The same command on an
 *       unspaced copy of the same tree exits 1 and names the staleness. That is
 *       `npm run verify:card-validation`, a guard, proving nothing.
 *   node scripts/gen-llms.mjs                              -> exit 0, llms.txt and
 *       llms-full.txt stay deleted.
 *   node scripts/gen-web-component-api.mjs                       -> exit 0 and prints
 *       "✓ dist/custom-elements.json — 80 elements", while web-component-meta.json,
 *       icon-names.json, web-component-types.d.ts, the React wrappers, llms.txt/llms-full.txt
 *       and docs/web-components.md are all skipped. Unspaced, the identical command
 *       prints eight ✓ lines. That is `npm run build:api`.
 *
 * WHY BEHAVIOURAL AND NOT A GREP. Banning the string `file://${` would be cheaper and
 * would have caught these three, but it checks spelling, not behaviour: it passes any
 * new hand-rolled form that is wrong in a way nobody has written yet, and it cannot
 * tell a guard that runs from a guard that is skipped — which is the entire defect.
 * This evaluates the REAL guard expressions, lifted out of the REAL sources, in a REAL
 * process whose entry path percent-encodes.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARD LIST IS EXTRACTED AND NOT RESTATED. Naming the scripts here would make
 * the fourth one — added next month, copied from one of these three — invisible. The
 * walk finds every `.mjs`/`.js` in the repo and the extractor finds every `if (…)` and
 * every `const`/`let`/`var` initializer whose text mentions both `import.meta.url` and
 * `process.argv[1]`, so a new script is covered the day it lands. `covers every script
 * that looks like it has a guard` below is what keeps the extractor honest: if it
 * silently stops matching, that assertion goes red rather than this file passing over
 * an empty list.
 *
 * IT HAS NOW DONE EXACTLY THAT, WHICH IS WHY THE DECLARATION FORM IS READ TOO. The
 * extractor originally looked only at `if (…)` conditions, so a guard FACTORED INTO A
 * NAMED CONST — `const IS_MAIN = …;` used by an `if (IS_MAIN)` further down — was
 * invisible: the `if` mentions neither token and the declaration was never read. The
 * script then counted as "looks guarded" with no guard extracted, and the coverage
 * assertion went red naming it, which is the tripwire working. Two scripts landed in
 * that shape at once (`lint-gate-parity.mjs`, `lint-threshold-derivation.mjs`), and it
 * is not peculiar to them — `INVOKED_DIRECTLY` in a scratch copy of another lint is a
 * third. Factoring the condition out is GOOD practice when three `if`s share it, so the
 * right fix was to widen the extractor rather than to make the scripts repeat
 * themselves. The population did not change and nothing was filtered out of discovery.
 *
 * WHY THE WALK IS ANCHORED AT THE REPO ROOT AND NOT AT `packages/ui`. It used to be
 * anchored at the package, which made the check's NAME broader than its POPULATION: a
 * guard in `.github/scripts/`, `apps/docs/scripts/`, `examples/` or at the repo root was
 * never evaluated, so this file could stay green while the exact defect it exists for
 * shipped one directory over. That is the same class of hole as the bug itself — a check
 * that passes because it is not looking. The anchor is asserted against a repo-root
 * marker file below, so moving this test file goes red loudly instead of silently
 * re-narrowing the net, and `walks past packages/ui` pins the widening itself.
 *
 * The fix, and the idiom already in `scripts/run-storybook-tests.mjs`:
 *
 *   import { pathToFileURL } from 'node:url';
 *   if (process.argv[1] && import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href) main();
 *
 * `pathToFileURL` is the idiom to REACH FOR, not the only spelling that is correct.
 * `examples/internal/openrouter-spike/harness/reasoning-coverage.mjs` compares
 * `resolve(process.argv[1])` against `resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`, which is
 * equally space-safe because `fileURLToPath` DECODES. This file tests behaviour, so that
 * guard passes on its merits; the fixture preamble below therefore has to put `resolve`
 * and `fileURLToPath` in scope alongside `pathToFileURL`, or a correct guard would blow
 * up as a ReferenceError and read as a failure.
