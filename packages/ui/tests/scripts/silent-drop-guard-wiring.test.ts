/**
 * GUARD — `lint:silent-drops` still DETECTS, and CI still runs it.
 *
 * The guard itself enforces CLAUDE.md's "decide loudly" corollary on `src/wire`,
 * where a dropped `MessagePart` variant is unrecoverable: the encoders turn parts
 * into a provider request, so a variant they do not encode is gone once the
 * request leaves the process. #186 shipped exactly that -- a user turn carrying
 * only an attachment encoded to nothing.
 *
 * This file exists because of HOW that guard would be lost. Not by someone
 * deleting it: by the `--self-test` half quietly dropping off the npm script, by
 * CI dropping the step, or by the analyzer degrading into a scan that matches
 * nothing and exits 0. All three make the suite faster and greener while covering
 * less, which is the exact shape of failure this repo keeps hitting, and a linter
 * that matches nothing looks identical to a clean tree from the outside.
 *
 * So the last two assertions do not trust the script's own self-report. They RUN
 * it against synthesized trees -- one that drops a variant, one where nothing
 * discriminates a part at all -- and require a non-zero exit from each.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion: deleting the `--self-test` half turns the
 * second red naming the script, deleting the CI step turns the third red naming
 * the job, and stubbing the analyzer's finding loop to `return []` turns the
 * fourth red while leaving every other test in this suite green.
