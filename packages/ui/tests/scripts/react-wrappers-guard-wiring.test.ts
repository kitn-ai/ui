/**
 * GUARD — `verify-react-wrappers` still DETECTS, and `build` still runs it.
 *
 * The guard itself asserts that every `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components/<X>` specifier in
 * dist/react.js resolves to a real emitted web-component file, and that the bundle opens
 * with 'use client'. Both failures are silent in production: a 404 on the lazy import
 * means `<Chat>` never registers, and a missing banner means RSC rejects the hooks.
 * It runs in `build`, and `prepublishOnly` runs `build`, so it gates every publish.
 *
 * This file exists because of HOW that guard would be lost: the `--self-test` half
 * dropping off the npm script, the `build` chain dropping the step, or the check
 * degrading into one that matches no specifiers and exits 0 — "zero of zero resolve"
 * is a pass that has looked at nothing.
 *
 * The FIRST assertion is the odd one and is deliberate. This guard's recorded defect
 * was a false POSITIVE: run with the wrong cwd it reported all 78 wrappers as pointing
 * at missing files, a loud alarm about nothing. No planted defect can catch that,
 * because every planted defect expects red — so a healthy tree is asserted to draw
 * exactly zero findings.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion: dropping `--self-test` from `verify:react-wrappers`
 * turns the wiring case red, replacing the `npm run` step in `build` turns the build
 * case red, and neutering the analyzer (`const missing = []`) turns the missing-file
 * case red while the rest of this file stays green.
