/**
 * GUARD — `verify-dts-boundaries` still DETECTS, and both places that run it still do.
 *
 * The guard itself walks every emitted .d.ts and asserts each relative specifier
 * resolves to real DECLARATIONS under both `bundler` and `nodenext` (ESM). It runs
 * in `postbuild` via `verify:dts` — so `prepublishOnly` reaches it — and again as its
 * own required-CI step.
 *
 * This file exists because of HOW that guard would be lost. Its own header records
 * the precedent: a hand-rolled stat list answered "does something plausible exist near
 * that path?" and passed green for MONTHS over a real TS7016, because
 * `dist/state/index.d.ts` satisfied the list while tsc took the sibling `dist/state.js`
 * and found no declarations beside it. A guard that agrees with itself rather than with
 * tsc is the failure mode, and it looks identical to a clean package from outside.
 *
 * So nothing here trusts the script's self-report. Each case RUNS it as a subprocess,
 * with NO `--self-test` flag, against a synthesized package root, and requires a
 * non-zero exit plus the right reason.
 *
 * THE DISARMED-COPY CONTROL. A fixture can go red for reasons that have nothing to do
 * with the analyzer — a crash, a missing file, a bad JSON parse — and that would look
 * exactly like detection. So each planted defect is ALSO run against a copy of the
 * script with its three finding-collectors neutered, and that copy must exit 0. If the
 * fixture were doing the work, the disarmed copy would still be red.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion: neutering `dangling.push` turns the TS7016 and TS2834
 * cases red; changing the final `process.exit(1)` to `process.exit(0)` turns every
 * planted-defect case red while the output still names the defect; dropping
 * `--self-test` from `verify:dts` or the step from `postbuild` turns the wiring cases
 * red. Each was performed.
