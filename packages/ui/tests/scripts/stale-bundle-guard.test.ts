/**
 * The stale-bundle guard's EXCLUSION SET — the thing that has been wrong twice.
 *
 * `tests/e2e/hover-card-global-setup.ts` refuses to run the hover-card suite
 * against a bundle older than the source it claims to test. Twice it counted
 * build OUTPUTS written into `src/` as if they were source edits, and the second
 * version broke a required CI job on an unrelated PR:
 *
 *   STALE BUNDLE — refusing to run.
 *     src/web-components/web-component-types.d.ts
 *     is 0s newer than the most recent build output (dist/llms/llms-full.txt).
 *
 * The exclusion is now DERIVED from `scripts/verify-generated-sync.mjs`, which
 * already owns the record of generated artifacts. These tests pin that
 * derivation: that it really reads the record, that it covers the file CI
 * tripped on, that it does NOT quietly widen to cover build INPUTS, and that a
 * record it cannot parse fails loudly instead of collapsing to an empty set —
 * an empty set restores the false positive silently, which is the worst
 * available outcome.
 *
 * The e2e setup is imported directly, which is only possible because it has no
 * top-level side effects. The script it READS (`verify-generated-sync.mjs`)
 * runs its guard and calls `process.exit` at module scope, which is exactly why
 * the setup parses that file instead of importing it.
