/**
 * GUARD — `lint:catalog-drift` still DETECTS, and CI still runs it.
 *
 * The guard itself resolves every authored claim in the composition catalog
 * (element tags, wiring events and properties, invariant ids, `enforcedBy`
 * paths, recipe corpus paths, inventory titles, scenario invariant refs)
 * against the derived layer and the tree. It exists because the authored layer
 * is prose about a tree that keeps moving, which is exactly how the old roster
 * died.
 *
 * This file exists because of HOW that guard would be lost. Not by someone
 * deleting it: by the `--self-test` half dropping off the npm script, by CI
 * dropping the step, or by `check()` degrading into something that returns no
 * errors for any input. All three make CI greener while covering less, and a
 * resolver that resolves nothing looks identical to a clean catalog from
 * outside.
 *
 * So the detection assertions do not trust the script's own self-report. They
 * RUN it, and they drive `check()` with fixtures — a fabricating one that must
 * produce a NAMED error, and a POSITIVE CONTROL that must come back clean. The
 * control is not decoration: an analyzer that threw on every input, or one
 * whose fixtures were malformed, would satisfy the negative assertion alone
 * while detecting nothing, which is the failure mode this branch keeps hitting.
 *
 * Watched failing, each mutation in ISOLATION against a 10-passing baseline:
 *
 *   - dropping the `--self-test` half from the npm script          -> 1 red (the script assertion)
 *   - deleting the CI step                                         -> 1 red (the CI assertion)
 *   - `check()` neutered to `return { errors: [], gaps: [] }`      -> 6 red
 *   - `check()` returning `{ errors: [], gaps }`, gaps preserved   -> 5 red
 *
 * The last two are the pair worth reading. Under the FULL neutering the
 * positive control goes red too, because it also asserts the `kind: 'none'`
 * gap survives — so it is not merely a decorative "did not throw". Under the
 * narrower mutation, which suppresses errors while leaving gaps intact, the
 * control stays GREEN and the four detection cases go red on their own. That is
 * the shape a positive control is supposed to have: it must be capable of
 * passing while the negative cases fail, or it is not a control.
