/**
 * GUARD — `lint:cdn-pins` still DETECTS, and CI still runs it.
 *
 * The guard itself keeps hand-typed `@kitn.ai/ui@<version>` CDN pins equal to
 * packages/ui/package.json. It exists because the docs correctly tell people to
 * pin an exact version for CDN use, and every pin was then a literal nobody
 * updated: when a Critical advisory landed against 0.14.1-0.24.0, four
 * copy-pasteable URLs across the docs and the npm README were still handing
 * readers 0.20.1 and 0.16.0. npm warns when you install a deprecated version;
 * a CDN fetch warns about nothing.
 *
 * This file exists because of HOW that guard would be lost. Not by someone
 * deleting it: by the `--self-test` half dropping off the npm script, by CI
 * dropping the step, or by the walk degrading into a scan that matches no file
 * and exits 0. All three make CI faster and greener while covering less, and a
 * linter that matches nothing looks identical to a clean tree from outside.
 *
 * So the last two assertions do not trust the script's own self-report. They RUN
 * it against synthesized trees -- one with a stale pin, one with no pin at all --
 * and require a non-zero exit from each.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion: deleting the `--self-test` half turns the
 * second red naming the script, deleting the CI step turns the third red naming
 * the job, and neutering the comparison to `f.stale = false` turns the fourth
 * red while leaving every other test in this suite green.

/**
 * GUARD — a release BUMP still reaches every live pin.
 *
 * The guard above compares pins against a version release-please rewrites, so
 * being green today says nothing about being green after the next bump: every
 * release moves one side and leaves the other alone. That is not hypothetical.
 * `release-please-config.json` carried no `extra-files` at all, so the release
 * commit for 0.25.1 (`8d56f1d7`) failed this guard and published anyway.
 *
 * The fix is release-please `extra-files` plus an `x-release-please-*`
 * annotation on each live pin line. Both halves are silent when absent: an
 * un-annotated pin is simply not rewritten, and the tree stays green until the
 * NEXT release turns the release commit red. These tests move that discovery
 * forward to the PR that adds the pin.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion, against real trees rather than a self-report:
 * removing an annotation, dropping a file from `extra-files`, putting a frozen
 * version ahead of the pin on an annotated line, and annotating a waived
 * historical line each turn exactly one of these red.
