/**
 * GUARD — `verify-generated-sync` still DETECTS DRIFT, and CI still runs it.
 *
 * The guard itself reruns the real generator and fails when a committed derived
 * artifact differs from what came out. fc40a10 is why: a new `::part(citations)`
 * went into src/web-components/slots/slots.ts, the artifacts derived from it were not
 * regenerated, and nothing went red — so a part that existed in the shipped element
 * was invisible to the `kai` MCP and the docs site, i.e. to every tool a developer
 * would use to find it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, precisely. The guard has TWO halves and only one of them
 * was ever exercised. The random per-run SENTINEL proves the generator RE-RAN — it
 * is watched failing every time a generator is deleted or no-ops. Nothing proved the
 * COMPARATOR still notices drift. Those can fail independently: the sentinel could
 * keep working perfectly while `a.equals(b)` was deleted, inverted, or handed the
 * wrong buffers, and every run would stay green over exactly the defect this guard
 * exists to catch. So the cases below let the sentinel clear NORMALLY and plant a
 * DRIFTED artifact, leaving the comparator as the only thing that can produce red.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE RUNS THE REAL CONFIGURATION, and that is not squeamishness. The guard
 * rewrites the derived files in the source tree for the duration of a run; the unit
 * suite runs in parallel and reads those same files. Every case points the script at
 * a synthesized repo with a stub generator via `--fixture-config`.
 *
 * Watched failing, per assertion: making the comparator always agree
 * (`if (true || a.equals(b))`) turns the drift cases red while the sentinel cases stay
 * green — which is the whole point of them being separate; dropping `--self-test`
 * from the npm script or the step from CI turns the wiring cases red.
