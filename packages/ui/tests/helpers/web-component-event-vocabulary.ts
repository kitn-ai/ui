// THE ALLOWLIST: every field of every `element.*` event must be drawn from a
// closed vocabulary. This is what makes "metadata only" a PROVABLE claim.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY SENTINEL SEARCHING WAS NOT ENOUGH.
//
// The boundary was previously asserted by planting sentinels in prop values and
// grepping the serialized events for them. That is a BLOCKLIST: it can only
// catch a leak you thought to name, in the FORM you thought to name it. A
// verifier demonstrated the gap rather than arguing it -- mutating
// `classifyAttributeValue` to append a 12-character TAIL slice of the raw
// attribute leaks real consumer text on every violation, and the sentinel
// searches did not see it. Reproduced here before this file was written: of
// seven hostile inputs, six leaked their tail past `toContain` untouched
// (`k-plain-text`, `eak-appended`, `nterminated"`, …) and the search fired on
// exactly one -- the input that happened to be a REPETITION of the sentinel
// token, so its tail contained a whole copy by luck. The blocklist's only hit
// was an accident of sentinel design.
//
// Head-anchoring the sentinels (the first repair) fixes head slices and nothing
// else. Tail slices, middle slices, case changes, base64 and any encoding all
// still walk past. There is no sentinel design that closes an open set of leak
// shapes.
//
// So invert it. `classifyAttributeValue` already returns from a genuinely closed
// vocabulary -- two fixed markers, a type name, and a LENGTH -- and every other
// string an element event carries is either a fixed literal or a name drawn
// from a GENERATED artifact. Asserting membership catches every leak shape at
// once, including the ones nobody has imagined, and it does not depend on
// sentinel design at all.
//
// The sentinel tests stay: they are cheap and they document intent. This is what
// makes the claim true.
