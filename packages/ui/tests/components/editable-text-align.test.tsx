/**
 * The editable text surfaces pin their own text alignment.
 *
 * THE BUG. `text-align` INHERITS. `Empty`'s root carried `text-center`, and
 * `Empty` slots arbitrary content — including a `PromptInput` — so the centering
 * reached in and centered both the placeholder and the typed text of the input.
 * Measured in Chromium: editable and placeholder `::before` both computed
 * `center`, typed text sat 149px from each edge. `Composer` (the control
 * `PromptInput` wraps) had the identical hole in its DEFAULT editable class and
 * reproduced the same way on `components-composer--playground`.
 *
 * THE PIN. An input control's reading direction is a fact about the control, so
 * it states it rather than inheriting it: `text-start` on the editable's class.
 * LOGICAL (`start`), never `text-left` — `text-left` pins the physical edge and
 * would put text on the left of an RTL field, a worse bug than the one it fixes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST CAN AND CANNOT SEE. jsdom has no cascade for INHERITED
 * properties — the negative control below shows an unpinned child of a centered
 * ancestor computing `''`, not `center` — so jsdom cannot reproduce the leak
 * itself. What it CAN do is resolve a class rule, so this file pins two things
 * that together make the fix real, and stops short of pretending to measure the
 * third:
 *   1. the CLASS: both editables emit `text-start` (this is a class-level
 *      assertion, not a computed-value one);
 *   2. that `text-start` is a REAL utility Tailwind emitted into the generated
 *      `compiled.css` as `text-align:start` — the check that would catch a typo
 *      or a Tailwind version that never shipped the logical utility, which is
 *      exactly how a class-level pin goes quietly inert;
 *   3. that with that rule loaded, the editable resolves to `start` under a
 *      centered ancestor.
 * The end-to-end consequence (real inheritance actually being stopped) is only
 * observable in a real browser and was measured there before and after the fix.
 *
 * `Composer` is covered separately from `PromptInput` on purpose: `editableCls()`
 * is `props.editableClass ?? cn(...)`, and a passed `editableClass` REPLACES the
 * default wholesale. `PromptInput` passes one, so it exercises a different string
 * than a bare `Composer` does and a fix to either alone leaves the other broken.
