/**
 * A teardown path must never resolve a DOM global.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR
 * -----------------------
 * `onCleanup(() => document.removeEventListener(...))` reads `document` off the
 * global object at DISPOSE time, not at setup time. Dispose is not guaranteed to
 * run while the page that mounted the component is still standing:
 *
 *   · `component-register`'s `disconnectedCallback` is `async` and starts with
 *     `await Promise.resolve()` — deliberately, so moving a `kai-*` element
 *     around the DOM doesn't destroy its Solid root. The release therefore lands
 *     one microtask AFTER whatever detached the element finished.
 *   · vitest's jsdom environment teardown is `dom.window.close()` (which sets
 *     `document.body.innerHTML = ""`, detaching every element synchronously)
 *     followed IMMEDIATELY, in the same synchronous run, by
 *     `keys.forEach(key => delete global[key])` — `document`, `window`, `self`,
 *     `top` and `parent` all stop existing.
 *
 * So the deferred release runs with the globals already gone, a bare `document`
 * throws `ReferenceError`, and because the throw happens inside an `async`
 * callback whose promise the DOM drops on the floor it surfaces as an UNHANDLED
 * REJECTION: every test passes, and the run still exits 1. That is exactly how it
 * was found, and why it looked nondeterministic — whether the worker process
 * lives long enough to drain that microtask and still have an open channel to
 * report on varies run to run.
 *
 * Consumers hit the same shape without vitest: any host that tears its
 * environment down between disposal and cleanup.
 *
 * THE RULE: capture the node/view at SETUP time and close over it. An object
 * property (`editable.ownerDocument`) or a captured binding (`const win = window`)
 * survives the global going away; a bare identifier does not.
 *
 * Two guards below, because neither covers the other:
 *   1. BEHAVIOURAL — mount each component that registers a global listener, delete
 *      the DOM globals, dispose, and require no throw. Deterministic: `dispose()`
 *      is synchronous, so the ordering that made the original symptom flaky is
 *      removed rather than waited on.
 *   2. STRUCTURAL — parse `src/` and walk the call graph out of every teardown
 *      callback, so a NEW `onCleanup` in a component nobody thought to add a case
 *      for is still caught — including one that reaches the global through a
 *      named function rather than inline. See the long note above `isScopeNode`
 *      for why that is a parser and not a regex.

 * Sites that are the SAME bug and are knowingly not fixed yet, keyed

 * `primitives/use-audio-analysis.ts`, `primitives/use-sequencer.ts` and
 * `components/audio-visualizer/labs/lab-visualizer.tsx` — recorded rather than
 * dropped from FRAGILE_GLOBALS, because dropping the global would have made the

 *
 * An allowlist that only ever fails on ADDITION rots closed: a site gets fixed,
 * nobody removes its entry, and the exemption silently outlives the bug — so the
 * next real regression at that exact site lands pre-approved and invisible. This
 * one is therefore checked in BOTH directions. Adding a new violation fails; so
 * does leaving an entry here once the scan can no longer find the violation it
 * names.
 *
 * The fix is NOT the `const win = window` capture that fixes a bare `document`.
 * `window === globalThis` — measured, in jsdom and in real Chromium/WebKit alike
 * — and the teardown deletes these keys off that very object, so the captured
 * view has nothing left to call. It only turns
 * `ReferenceError: cancelAnimationFrame is not defined` into
 * `TypeError: win.cancelAnimationFrame is not a function`, which was watched
 * happening before the working fix went in. Capture the FUNCTION at setup
 * instead: `const cancelFrame = cancelAnimationFrame.bind(globalThis)`.
 *
 * One caveat on WHERE that line goes. Inside a `createEffect`/`onMount` it can be
 * written bare, because SSR never runs those. At COMPONENT-BODY scope it cannot:
 * a server render does execute the body, Node has no `cancelAnimationFrame`, and
 * the bare form turns the disposal crash into an SSR crash. The two body-scope
 * sites (`create-tween.ts`, `shader-canvas.tsx`) therefore guard the capture with
 * `typeof cancelAnimationFrame === 'function'`; the "still construct where rAF

/*
 * WHY THIS IS A PARSER AND NOT A REGEX
 * ------------------------------------
 * This scan used to read the literal argument TEXT of each `onCleanup(...)` call
 * and look for `document.`/`matchMedia(` in it. That works only while the offending
 * read is written inside the callback. It is invisible the moment the callback
 * delegates:
 *
 *     const stop = () => { if (raf) cancelAnimationFrame(raf); };   // <- the bug
 *     onCleanup(() => { disposed = true; stop(); });                // <- what it read
 *
 * Two live sites were shaped exactly like that -- `primitives/create-tween.ts` and
 * `components/audio-visualizer/shader-canvas.tsx`, the latter two hops deep
 * (`onCleanup(release)` -> `release()` -> `stopLoop()`) -- and the text scan was
 * green across both the whole time they were broken. A green check over a bug it
 * structurally cannot see is worse than no check: it is the reason nobody looked.
 *
 * So the scan resolves callees to their bodies instead of matching text. It parses
 * each file with the TypeScript compiler's own parser (syntax only -- no program,
 * no type checker, no tsconfig), builds a lexical scope chain, and from every
 * teardown callback walks the LOCAL CALL GRAPH transitively. Depth is unbounded, so
 * adding another hop between the callback and the bug does not restore the blind
 * spot. Scope resolution is what makes it precise in both directions: a name that
 * binds to a local is not a global (no false alarm on a `const document = ...`),
 * and a name that binds to nothing IS one (no false calm on an aliased read).
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, stated plainly rather than papered over:
 *
 *   1. It is PER-FILE. A callee that is imported is not followed into the module
 *      that defines it. Cross-module resolution needs real module resolution, and
 *      the payoff is small here: a hook that registers its own cleanup is scanned
 *      in its own file anyway, so only a directly-imported disposer would slip
 *      through, and there is currently no such site.
 *   2. It resolves NAMES, not VALUES. A disposer produced by a call
 *      (`onCleanup(makeDisposer())`) or read off an object
 *      (`onCleanup(parent.register(el))`) has no syntactic body to walk. Tracking
 *      those needs data-flow, not name resolution.
 *
 * (2) is not left silent: every teardown callback the walker cannot resolve is
 * reported, and UNRESOLVED_TEARDOWN_CALLBACKS below pins the exact set, so a NEW
 * unresolvable one fails this suite and gets read by a human instead of vanishing
 * into a blind spot. The FIXTURE at the bottom then tests the analyzer itself
 * against source whose answer is known, because an analyzer that silently stopped
 * resolving anything would otherwise report zero offenders and look like a pass.

 * a new unresolvable disposer fails here and gets looked at by a person, instead of
 * being quietly excluded by an analyzer that reports nothing about what it skipped.
 *
 * Keyed by file and callback name, deliberately WITHOUT a line number. A line here
 * would make this suite go red for any edit that merely shifted those files, which
 * trains people to update the expectation without reading it — the exact reflex
