/**
 * CAPABILITY 2 — the re-render contract, reported as a diagnostic.
 *
 * The rule, verbatim from root CLAUDE.md and pinned as BEHAVIOUR by
 * `components/reactivity-contract/reactivity-contract.test.tsx`:
 *
 *   A new array reference is what NOTIFIES  — the same array set back is a
 *                                             no-op, even with an item swapped
 *                                             inside it.
 *   A new object for the changed item is what makes the change VISIBLE — the
 *                                             lists render through
 *                                             reference-keyed <For>s, so a row
 *                                             whose item identity is unchanged
 *                                             is never re-invoked.
 *
 * That test proves the web components behave this way. This one reports it: issue
 * #224 was filed by a user who did the wrong thing, saw the right data in
 * DevTools, and had no way to find out why the screen disagreed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. `mutated-in-place` cannot mean "you
 * changed an item", because knowing an item changed requires comparing its
 * CONTENT, and content is payload. What it means is the structurally knowable
 * thing: a new array arrived, it is the same length, and every item in it is
 * reference-identical to the previous array's — so the signal notified and not
 * one row can re-render. Whether the consumer meant anything by that write is
 * a question only the consumer can answer.
 *
 * NOT VACUOUS: every "fires" case is paired with a "does not fire" case over
 * the same element and the same prop, so a detector wired to fire on everything
 * and a harness observing nothing both go red.
