/**
 * The two generated element artifacts disagree, and NOTHING asserted that until
 * this file. That is the actual defect — not the disagreement, which turns out
 * to be deliberate and documented, but the fact that no gate had an opinion
 * about it either way.
 *
 * WHAT DIVERGES, AND WHY
 * ----------------------
 * `web-component-meta.json` has 80 entries; `web-component-manifest.json` has 79 tags. The
 * difference is `kai-remote`, and the two generators simply answer two different
 * questions:
 *
 *   gen-web-component-api.mjs       scans the src/web-components DIRECTORY LISTING, so it
 *                             describes every web component that EXISTS.
 *   gen-web-components-manifest.mjs reads the import list in register-impl.ts, so it
 *                             describes every web component the register-all bundle
 *                             REGISTERS.
 *
 * `<kai-remote>` mounts a sandboxed cross-origin iframe card and is opt-in by
 * design, reachable through `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components/remote` or the React `Remote`
 * wrapper and deliberately absent from register-impl.ts. `config/vite/web-components.ts`
 * says exactly that at the site, and builds its per-web-component module explicitly so
 * the subpath still resolves.
 *
 * So the two counts SHOULD differ, by exactly this one tag. The devtools spec
 * reads the same divergence as a data defect — "a one-line data fix", "the
 * interesting question is why verify:generated did not catch it" — and that
 * diagnosis is wrong in a way worth pinning: adding `kai-remote` to the manifest
 * would hand an opt-in cross-origin iframe element to the autoloader's
 * lazy-load set. That is a behaviour change wearing the costume of a data fix.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST IS FOR
 * ---------------------
 * Not to assert the counts are equal — they must not be. To pin the divergence
 * at exactly this one KNOWN tag, so that:
 *   - a NEW element that exists but never registers fails here, loudly, instead
 *     of being absorbed into a difference someone already decided was fine;
 *   - `kai-remote` being wired into register-impl also fails here, because the
 *     exception would then be stale;
 *   - the web-component registry snapshot's universe (the manifest) has something
 *     standing behind its choice.
