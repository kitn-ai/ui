// The ELEMENT-layer diagnostic events: what the `kai-*` custom elements SAW a
// consumer do to them.
//
// The wire events answer "did the data arrive". These answer the other half —
// "the data is right and the UI still is not updating" — which is a different
// failure with a different cause and, until now, no evidence at all. All three
// causes are documented in root CLAUDE.md's `kai-` contract section, and every
// one of them is silent by construction:
//
//   1. An array or object prop set as an HTML ATTRIBUTE. `component-register`
//      parses attributes with a `JSON.parse` whose `catch` returns the raw
//      string, so `el.setAttribute('messages', arr)` assigns the literal text
//      `"[object Object],[object Object]"` to the property and pushes THAT into
//      the Solid signal. Nothing throws, nothing logs, nothing renders.
//   2. The SAME array reference handed back. solid-element creates one signal
//      per prop and sets it with `set(() => v)`; Solid's default equality is
//      `===`, so re-assigning the identical reference notifies nothing.
//   3. A NEW array whose items are all the previous item objects. The array
//      notifies, but the lists render through reference-keyed `<For>`s, so no
//      row is re-invoked and nothing on screen changes.
//
// ZERO IMPORTS, DELIBERATELY. These are type declarations only, so this file is
// erased at build. That is what lets `wire/diagnostics.ts` name them in its
// union without `wire/` acquiring a runtime dependency on `elements/` — which
// would be a real layering inversion, and would drag the element bundle into
// every consumer that only parses streams.
//
// METADATA ONLY, by the same rule the wire events follow: if a value comes from
// the model, the end user, or the app's data it is PAYLOAD; if it describes the
// shape, size, timing or identity of that value it is METADATA. A tag name, a
// prop name, a kind, a count and a length are all identity or shape. A prop's
// VALUE never appears in any field below — `valuePreview` is a shape
// description built from a closed vocabulary, never the text itself. Pinned by
// `web-component-diagnostics-payload.test.ts`, which plants a sentinel inside every
// prop value it sets and asserts it never reaches a serialized event.
