/**
 * The data shapes a consumer assigns to a `kai-*` element's array/object
 * properties, when that shape has no Solid-layer twin they could import instead.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The generated `.d.ts` for `./web-components` and the React
 * wrappers expand every prop type STRUCTURALLY (see the `IMPORTS = {}` note in
 * scripts/gen-web-component-api.mjs — self-contained declarations are what keeps a
 * consumer's tsc from resolving library `.ts` source). That is right for the
 * generated files, but it means a consumer who wants to name the shape — a
 * `const items: … = [...]` in their own code, a helper that builds one — has no
 * type to import and ends up writing
 * `NonNullable<KaiCommandElementProps['items']>`. Every named element-prop type
 * must therefore be reachable from the ROOT entry (`@kitn.ai/ui`), which is what
 * a React / Vue / Svelte / vanilla consumer imports. Enforced by
 * tests/web-components/prop-types-exported.test.ts.
 *
 * These live in their own module (not in the facades that use them) because the
 * facades compile to per-web-component side-effect entry points whose shipped
 * declarations are `export {};` — a type re-exported from one of those would not
 * resolve for a consumer. Types with a Solid twin (`TriggerDef`, `KaiNavItem`,
 * `ChatThreadContextUsage`, …) stay in their own layer's module and are
 * re-exported from `src/index.ts` directly.
 *
 * Type-only: fully erased by the build, so the root barrel pays nothing.
