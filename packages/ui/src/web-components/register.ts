// SSR-safe: the kai-* web-components bundle Solid's client runtime, which touches
// `window` at module-eval (delegateEvents(events, doc = window.document)). With
// no `window`, a static import would throw. So the actual component registration
// lives in ./register-impl and is loaded behind a browser check + dynamic
// import() — static ESM imports hoist + evaluate unconditionally, so a bare `if`
// cannot gate them; a dynamic import() can. On the server this module is inert
// (no DOM → no registration → no throw); in the browser it registers as before.
//
// Registration is async (a microtask after this module loads). Consumers that
// need the upgraded element (e.g. the React runtime) guard with
// customElements.whenDefined(), which resolves once the impl chunk has run.
/** Resolves once the kai-* elements are registered (browser); inert on the server.
 *  Await this instead of customElements.whenDefined for a single ready signal.

 *  NOTE: this MUST stay an exported binding. A bare `void import('./register-impl')`
 *  is a result-unused dynamic import that the single-entry register-all build
 *  (KAI_BUILD=register, config/vite/web-components.ts → dist/kai.es.js) tree-shakes away
 *  as dead code, leaving the bundle with NOTHING registered. Exporting the promise

// consumer following our own docs hit an unresolvable import. Total, deterministic
// and always terminating in 'generic' — safe to expose, and needed by anyone
// rendering tool calls themselves. tool-classify.ts imports nothing, so this stays

// Element-layer diagnostics. `emitWebComponentRegistry()` re-emits the which-elements-

// missed the one register-impl emits at load. SSR-safe and a no-op with no
// subscriber, so calling it unconditionally is fine.
//
// WHY THIS ONE PRODUCER IS PUBLIC while `@kitn.ai/ui/diagnostics` deliberately
// keeps `emitWireDiagnostic`, `nextStreamId` and `setWirePayloadCapture`
// internal. That rule exists because a consumer able to forge events or reset
// the stream counter can make a panel lie about a stream that never happened,
// and one able to flip payload capture can start recording an app's users'
// conversations without the app deciding to. This function takes no arguments
// and reports nothing but `customElements.get()` over the manifest: there is no
// value to forge, no counter to move and no capture to arm. It can only tell the
// truth about the registry, which is the one thing a late-attaching panel cannot
// find out for itself.
//

// a consumer already importing the web-components entry should not have to add a
