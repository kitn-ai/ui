// Element-layer observability: the OTHER half of "why isn't it updating".
//
// The wire diagnostics answer "did the data arrive". Everything here answers the
// question a developer asks NEXT, after they have confirmed in the console that
// `el.messages` holds exactly what they expect and the screen still shows the
// old thing. All three causes are contract violations documented in root
// CLAUDE.md, and all three are silent by construction rather than by oversight.
// See `./diagnostic-events.ts` for what each one is and why it is detectable.
//
// WHERE THIS HOOKS, AND WHY THERE. `defineWebComponent` is the single choke
// point -- every `kai-*` element registers through it, and `web-components/slots.test.ts`
// already fails the build if a registered tag has no `defineWebComponent` call.
// So one install site covers all 79 registered web components with no per-web-component
// work and no list to keep in step.
//
// OBSERVE-ONLY, AND STRUCTURALLY SO. Two of the three hooks are wrappers around
// prototype methods, which is the risky shape, so the discipline is fixed:
//
//   * the inner method is ALWAYS called, exactly once, with the arguments
//     untouched, and no branch can skip it;
//   * its return value is passed straight back;
//   * everything else this file does is a read.
//
// The ORDER of the observation relative to the delegation differs between the
// two, and each site says why. `connectedCallback` observes after, because the
// channel it registers on does not exist until the inner call has run.
// `attributeChangedCallback` observes BEFORE, because the inner call is what
// throws on the very input being reported, and a report after it would go
// missing in exactly the case it exists to explain.
//
// The third hook is not a wrapper at all: `addPropertyChangedCallback` is
// component-register's own public observation channel -- solid-element itself
// uses it to bridge props into signals -- so a second listener is purely
// additive and cannot alter a value or an ordering.
//
// EVERY observation is wrapped in a try/catch, for the same reason
// `emitWireDiagnostic` swallows a subscriber's throw: a diagnostic that breaks
// the element it is watching is worse than no diagnostic. A bug in this file
// must cost a missing event, never a dead component.
//
// ZERO COST WHEN NOBODY IS SUBSCRIBED. This runs on the hottest path in the kit
// -- every prop set on every web component, which during streaming is every chunk --
// so the ordering of the guards is load-bearing:
//
//   1. AT REGISTRATION: an element with no non-scalar prop (37 of the 80 in
//      `web-component-nonscalar.json`) installs NOTHING. No wrapper, no closure, no
//      per-instance cost, ever.
//   2. ON EVERY CALL: `wireDiagnosticsActive()` is checked BEFORE constructing
//      an event, building a string, or touching an attribute -- one symbol read
//      on `globalThis` plus an array-length compare, allocating nothing.
//
// SSR-SAFE: no `window`, `document` or `customElements` at module scope. The
// registry snapshot touches `customElements` only inside its function body, and
// returns undefined where there is none.

 * but whose element bundle never loaded renders empty boxes, throws nothing and
 * logs nothing. The SSR starters already answer this by hand for a hard-coded
 * handful (`HydrationBadge.tsx` in the nextjs and tanstack-start starters); this
 * is the same answer, derived, over every tag.
 *
 * WHY THE MANIFEST AND NOT `web-component-meta.json`. The two generated artifacts
 * disagree -- 79 tags against 80 entries -- and the manifest is the one that
 * answers THIS question. `kai-remote` is in the meta file because
 * `gen-web-component-api.mjs` scans the `src/web-components` directory listing, and absent
 * from the manifest because `gen-web-components-manifest.mjs` reads the import list in
 * `register-impl.ts`, which does not import `remote.tsx`.
 *
 * AND THAT IS DELIBERATE, not a generator bug -- the `remote` entry in
 * `splitConfig()`'s `entry` map in `config/vite/web-components.ts` says so at the site:
 * `<kai-remote>` mounts a sandboxed cross-origin iframe and
 * is opt-in, reachable only through `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components/remote` or the React
 * `Remote` wrapper, and intentionally kept out of the register-all bundle. So
 * the honest universe for "did the element bundle load" is the 79 that bundle
 * registers. Listing `kai-remote` beside them would report a permanent "not
 * defined" against an element almost no app is missing, and adding it to the
 * manifest -- the obvious "fix" -- would hand an opt-in cross-origin iframe
 * element to the autoloader's lazy-load set, which is a behaviour change wearing
 * the costume of a data fix.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: a consumer who HAS opted into
 * `kai-remote` sees it in neither list. `web-component-artifact-divergence.test.ts`
 * pins the divergence at exactly this one tag, so it stays a known exception and
 * a NEW one fails.
 *
 * Returns the event it emitted, or `undefined` where there is no custom-element
