  // has is markup-then-assign: the element connects with no tool, renders nothing, and
  // the Collapsible — and therefore the controller — arrives a tick later.
  //
  // With a plain `let`, wireDisclosure's effects ran once against `undefined` and never
  // again, because the getter they were handed was not reactive and a bare `open`
  // attribute never changes `props.open` to re-trigger them. Net result: `<kai-tool open>`
  // silently stayed shut while `el.open` read back `true` — the property and the
  // rendering disagreed. Making the controller reactive is the whole fix: the effects
  // re-run the moment it lands. `Tool` already tracks its own copy this way internally.

  // after mount is parsed by component-register to `undefined`, so the prop never
  // changes and nothing re-renders. reflectFlag's coercing setter resolves that
  // `undefined` back through the same `flag()` policy, which is what makes the plain
  // HTML gesture work at runtime and not only at parse time.
