 * declared dependency of this package, so reaching past solid-element to call
 * `register` ourselves would ship an undeclared import to consumers. Intercepting
 * the one `define` call is the smallest seam that exists.
 *
 * The wrap is synchronous, restored in a `finally`, delegates to whatever was

                (kai-view-stack's back()-lands-on-the-wrong-root bug, commit
                6744a412; kai-pane-group's select()-goes-dead bug, pinned in
                tests/web-components/pane-group.test.tsx). This matches how Solid
                itself runs components (createComponent untracks the body):
                reactivity flows through the returned JSX's own effects, which are
                created under the owner and unaffected by untrack. A facade needing
                a live prop read uses a thunk, memo or effect — same as any Solid
                component. Seam pinned by the facade-bodies-run-once test in
                tests/web-components/define.test.tsx. */}
            {untrack(() =>
              Facade(props as unknown as P, {
                element,
                dispatch,
                flag,
                reflectFlag,
                expose,

  // Element-layer diagnostics: report the three `kai-` contract violations that
  // are otherwise silent (an array or object prop set as an HTML attribute, the
  // same array reference handed back, a new array of the same item objects).
  //
  // HERE because this function is the single choke point — every kai-* element
  // registers through it, which `web-components/slots/slots.test.ts` already enforces — so
  // one call covers every web component with no per-web-component work and no second list.
  //
  // Through the pre-define seam, not after the fact, because the registry
  // snapshots lifecycle callbacks at definition time; see `alsoPatch` above.
  // `webComponentDiagnosticsWanted` is asked first so a tag with no non-scalar prop
  // (37 of the 80) does not even pay for the registry interception.
  const wantsDiagnostics = webComponentDiagnosticsWanted(tag);

  const { result: Ctor, handled } = defineWithNonReflectingProps(
    tag,
    shadowedProps,
    () => customElement(tag, defaults, renderFacade),
    wantsDiagnostics ? (proto) => installElementDiagnostics(tag, proto) : undefined,
  );

  // Belt and braces for the one path the wrap cannot see: if `customElements.define`
  // was never reached for this tag (a registry that defines lazily, or a future
  // solid-element that stops calling it synchronously), install on the returned class
  // instead. That is the OLD, too-late timing — it still protects every web component
  // constructed from here on, it just cannot rescue an already-upgraded one. Skipped
  // in the normal case, where the accessors are already on this same prototype.
  const proto = (Ctor as unknown as { prototype?: object } | undefined)?.prototype;
  if (!handled && proto) installNonReflectingProps(proto, shadowedProps);

  // NOTE the diagnostics have no equivalent late fallback, and must not get one.
  // The non-reflecting props still work when installed late (they only have to
  // beat the NEXT constructor); the diagnostics do not, because the registry has
  // already snapshotted the lifecycle callbacks it will invoke. Installing them
  // here would produce a wrapper that is visibly present and never called —
  // which is worse than not installing it, since it would read as coverage. So
  // in the one environment the pre-define seam cannot reach (a frozen registry:
  // SES lockdown, a sealed polyfill), element diagnostics are simply absent, and
  // every other element behaviour is unaffected.
