/**

 *
 * SLOTTED into `<kai-conversations>`' light DOM (a direct child): the consumer
 * owns the loop (framework-native `map`, `<For>`, `v-for`); the container
 * detects these children, skips its data rendering, and runs the parent-item
 * contract over them — selection state flowing container to item, roving
 * tabindex, arrow-key traversal, and the accessible list/row relationship
 * (list rows with button bodies and `aria-current` marking the active one;
 * axe's nested-interactive and aria-required-children
 * rules are why this is not listbox/option). Activation (click, Enter, Space)
 * surfaces as `kai-conversation-select` on the container, and the item itself
 * fires nothing — no double event.
 *
 * STANDALONE (anywhere else — a hand-composed rail, or wrapped in another
 * element even inside a container, since the container manages only direct
 * children): the row activates ITSELF.
 * Its shadow body is a tabbable `role="button"`, and click / Enter / Space
 * fire `kai-select` on this element with `{ id }` — non-bubbling, like every
 * `kai-*` event, so listen on the item itself. What a standalone row does NOT
 * have is the container's LIST story: roving tabindex across rows, arrow-key
 * traversal, and the shared `role="list"` relationship — each standalone row
 * is an ordinary tab stop, and a hand-composed rail brings its own list
 * semantics (or slots the rows into `<kai-conversations>` and gets them for
 * free).
 *
 * Slots: the default slot is the title; `leading`, `meta` and `menu` are the
 * named regions. The `menu` slot takes your OWN popover (rename, fork, archive
 * live there); the element provides only the region plus focus and ARIA
 * plumbing, never a declarative actions prop, and a click inside it never
 * selects the row — in either placement.
