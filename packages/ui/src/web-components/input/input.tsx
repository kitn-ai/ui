  //     with `notify: false` on purpose. The display re-formats, `el.value` does not.
  //   - `update()` notifies only when the FORMATTED text changed, so a reconfiguration
  //     that moves the canonical value WITHOUT moving the display is silent by design:
  //     flipping `semantic` from `custom` to `tel` under `###-###-####` turns
  //     `555-123-4567` into `5551234567` on the wire and changes nothing on screen.
  //
  // Either way `el.value` would go on serving a stale canonical value indefinitely -- and
  // an external write does NOT repair it, because an edit whose raw value comes out
  // unchanged commits nothing and notifies nobody. Only a keystroke did. So the facade
  // re-derives, from the text the masker has settled on.
  //
  // WHAT IT RE-FITS, and why not simply the text on screen. While a mask is on, the text
  // on screen can carry GUIDE characters at the unfilled positions, and a guide character
  // that happens to fit the position class would be absorbed as content on the way back
  // in. The previous CANONICAL value has no guide in it and is the faithful record of what
  // the user actually entered, so that is the input -- the same thing `update()` re-fits
  // from. With no mask there is no canonical form to speak of, so the field text is it.
  //
  // WHY A MICROTASK. This effect is created before the JSX below, so on any flush it runs
  // BEFORE the mask effect inside `Input`: reading or writing here would race the masker
