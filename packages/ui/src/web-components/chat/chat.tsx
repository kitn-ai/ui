  // flowing through `Omit`'s pass-through). `onHomeLink` is wired internally
  // (JSX prop on `<ChatThread>` below) as a dispatched `kai-home-link` event,
  // matching every other ChatThread callback on this element — same reasoning
  // as `onConversationLoad` just below.
  | 'home' | 'onHomeLink'
  // `onConversationLoad` is wired internally (below, JSX prop on
  // `<ChatThread>`) as a dispatched `kai-conversation-load` event — matching
  // every other ChatThread callback on this element — rather than left as a
  // settable JS property: a `JSX.Element`-shaped callback prop has no HTML-

  // idiom for "this thread wants to tell you something" is already an event.
  // Excluded from `Props` for the same reason `onValueChange`/`onSubmit`/etc
  // are excluded above: it is not a property a consumer of `<kai-chat>` sets.

  // `hostOpen` is re-declared below (own element-facing doc comment, same
  // reason as `conversations`/`store`); `onUnreadChange` is wired internally
  // (JSX prop on `<ChatThread>` below) as a dispatched `kai-unread-change`
  // event, matching every other ChatThread callback on this element. Both
  // were EXCLUDED entirely until the 2026-08-31 composition spike: the old
  // reasoning was that `<kai-chat>` has no sibling chrome of its own to
  // report to — true, but a CONSUMER composing this element beside their own
  // launcher/dock (the spike's hand-composed widget) is exactly such sibling
  // chrome, and without this seam the kit-owned unread computation was
  // unreachable from the public element surface (report: research/
  // 2026-08-31-composition-spike, "Real gap 1").

  // `<kai-chat>` is the OPPOSITE shape: a custom element crossing the shadow-DOM
  // boundary, where a `JSX.Element` value cannot exist for a consumer to construct
  // (React/Vue/plain HTML have no such type) and the facade already has its own
  // working mechanism for both regions — `slot="header-end"` and `slot="empty"`.
  // Omitted here rather than left to flow through `Omit`'s default pass-through:
  // without this, `gen-web-component-api.mjs` picked them up and put a JSX.Element type
  // (which it stringifies as Solid's internal array-like union — meaningless to a
  // web-component consumer) into `<kai-chat>`'s public prop surface and docs.
