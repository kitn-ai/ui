/**
 * `<kai-dock>` — the corner launcher: a floating button pinned to a corner of the
 * viewport, and a panel above it holding whatever you slot in. This is the "chat
 * bubble in the bottom-right" affordance. (Not to be confused with
 * `<kai-prompt-dock>`, which is a recessed tray that frames a prompt INPUT and does
 * not float, launch or open anything.)
 *
 * **How to use** — slot the surface, and let the dock own the button:
 * ```html
 * <kai-dock label="Aurora support">
 *   <kai-chat slot="panel" chat-title="Aurora Support"></kai-chat>
 * </kai-dock>
 * ```
 *
 * The panel is content-agnostic: a `<kai-chat>`, a form, your own element. The dock
 * never reads or types it. `slot="launcher"` / `slot="launcher-open"` swap the icon
 * INSIDE the built-in button — the button itself is never slotted away, because the
 * dock owns `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, the toggle wiring and the focus return,
 * and a replaced button would take all four with it.
 *
 * Open state is the standard disclosure surface: settable+reflecting `open`,
 * `kai-open-change`, and `show()`/`hide()`/`toggle()`; seed with `default-open`. It
 * also exposes `focus()` — the panel while open, the launcher while closed.
 *
 * Neither `default-open` nor `open` moves focus at mount. A widget docked on someone
 * else's page does not get to steal focus on load, which is the one place this
 * element differs from `<kai-dialog>`, where a modal opened at mount takes focus on
 * purpose. Opening it later does move focus, per `focus-on-open`.
 *
 * Closed does not mean gone: the panel keeps its layout box (`visibility: hidden` +
 * `inert`), so a thread inside it never re-measures from zero and a reply that lands
 * while closed is really there. `unread` is yours to set and yours to clear; the dot
 * just stops rendering while open.
 *
 * Escape closes only while the dock holds focus, and is never swallowed — a widget
 * docked on someone else's page does not get to eat their Escape. There is no focus
 * trap; the page stays usable, which is the point of "docked".
 *
 * Geometry is CSS custom properties, not props: `--kai-dock-width` ·
 * `--kai-dock-height` · `--kai-dock-inset` · `--kai-dock-gap` · `--kai-dock-radius` ·
 * `--kai-dock-z` · `--kai-dock-launcher-size`. Narrow viewports go full-bleed by
 * default. Parts: `launcher` · `panel` · `badge`.
 *
 * Put it as a body-level child: a `transform` / `filter` / `contain` ancestor makes
 * `position: fixed` resolve against that ancestor instead of the viewport.
 *
 * **Migrating a hand-rolled widget onto this element changes two behaviours**, both
 * deliberately, so check them rather than assuming a drop-in:
 *
 * 1. **Escape is scoped to the dock.** Hand-rolled versions of this widget typically
 *    listen on `document` and close on any Escape anywhere on the page. This one
 *    closes only while the dock holds focus, and never stops the event. If your app
 *    relied on Escape-anywhere, that is now the host page's key again.
 * 2. **The panel keeps its layout box while closed.** It is hidden with
 *    `visibility` + `inert`, not `display: none`, and is never unmounted, so whatever
 *    you slot in KEEPS RENDERING in the background: a stream still folds in, timers
 *    still run, and heights stay measured. That is what makes `unread` honest and
 *    what stops a reopened thread re-measuring from zero, but it does mean a panel
 *    that was free while `display: none` no longer is.

  // That effect runs a tick after mount, so `<kai-dock open>` would mount closed and

  // UNTRACKED, and that is not defensive noise — it is the fix for a real defect this

  // scope that inserts it, so a bare `flag('open')` here subscribes the WHOLE FACADE
  // to `open`: every toggle re-ran it, which re-created the `<Dock>`, its panel div
  // and its controller. The visible symptoms were far away from the cause — focus
  // never moved (each fresh focus effect was re-seeded with the current state, so it
  // saw no transition) and `kai-open-change` never fired (wireDisclosure had latched
  // the first, discarded controller). Reading a prop at the top level of a facade is
