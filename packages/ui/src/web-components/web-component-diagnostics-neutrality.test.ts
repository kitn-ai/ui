/**
 * OBSERVE-ONLY, PROVEN RATHER THAN PROMISED.
 *
 * This capability wraps two prototype lifecycle callbacks on every web component that
 * has a non-scalar prop — which is the single most dangerous shape a diagnostic
 * can take. A wrapper that swallowed a call, reordered one, changed an argument
 * or shifted a timing would break rendering for every consumer of the kit, and
 * it would break it only when a panel happened to be attached, which is the
 * worst possible failure schedule.
 *
 * So the claim is not "it looks observe-only". The claim is: for the same
 * script of operations, an element behaves IDENTICALLY with a subscriber
 * attached and without one. Two things are compared, because either alone is
 * weak:
 *
 *   the rendered DOM        — what the user sees. Compared as the full shadow
 *                             root markup, not a probe of one node.
 *   the prop-update sequence — what the element was TOLD, in order, with the
 *                             identity of each value. A wrapper that changed
 *                             what reached the signal, or when, shows up here
 *                             even if the final DOM happened to converge.
 *
 * AND THE HARNESS PROVES ITSELF. A "these two runs match" test passes
 * beautifully when both runs are empty, when the element never mounted, or when
 * the comparison reads nothing — the exact vacuity this repo keeps hitting. So
 * every comparison is preceded by an assertion that the recording is non-empty
 * and that the element really rendered, and one case deliberately makes the two
 * runs differ to show the comparison can fail at all.

 * differ in those attributes — with or without diagnostics, and this suite
