/**
 * THE HEADLINE: a developer's OWN card type is validated IN THE BROWSER.
 *
 * Everything else in the card-validation suite checks one of OUR seven built-ins.
 * That is the demo. This file is the point: a consumer registers `pricing-table`
 * with a schema, a model emits a malformed one, and the browser replaces it with a
 * diagnostic naming the failing field path — the same outcome a built-in gets, and
 * the same outcome the SERVER-side `registry.validate()` already produced.
 *
 * Asserted through the REAL COMPOSITION (`<kai-thread>`, `<kai-chat>`,
 * `<kai-message>` mounted with a `card` message part), not against
 * `validateCardData` directly. A unit test on the validator passes with the third
 * argument threaded or not, so it proves nothing about the dispatcher — which is
 * exactly how the gap survived: `validateCardData(type, data, schemas?)` already
 * took the argument and NOTHING passed it.
 *
 * Each test names the branch it expects to take, because the gate has four of them:
 *   1. consumer schema present  -> validate against THEIRS (whatever renders)
 *   2. no consumer schema, built-in renderer     -> validate against OURS
 *   3. no consumer schema, overridden renderer   -> do NOT validate  (pinned below)
 *   4. no consumer schema, unknown type          -> nothing to check

 * That is not decoration. It is the reason the prop is typed `Record<string,

 * those four keywords and pins `type` to a literal union, so this object literal
 * (and every `import schema from './x.schema.json'`, where TS widens `type` to
 * `string`) would be a TYPE ERROR against the tighter type. src/schemas/index.ts
 * widens `CardSchema` for exactly this reason. If someone tightens the prop, this
