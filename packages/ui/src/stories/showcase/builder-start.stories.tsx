// surface the wizard, the builder, and the commercial lay-person flow are
// all meant to CONVERGE on eventually (one template registry, one picker —
// not three separately-invented ones). Story-first, like every round on
// this branch: nothing here is wired to a real template's control panel yet
// (that's Round W onward, per template, per T-6) — this round's whole job is
// to make the template identities (names, one-liners, illustrations) exist
// and feel like part of the kitn brand before any controls get built
// against them. Round P2 grew the set to six and removed the selection
// readout below the grid — the card's own ring/highlight is the only
// selection statement now, per owner direction.

// The AI/UI brand magenta — the exact value `.storybook/preview.ts`'s own
// manager brandmark uses, and the one T-7 means by "the magenta accent".
// `builder-start.tsx` itself stays token-only (`var(--color-primary)`
// inside the illustrations, `border-primary`/`ring-primary` on the card) —
// the kit's own default `--color-primary` is a NEUTRAL near-black/near-white
// (this is a white-label component library; a consumer's own construct sets
// its own accent), so it renders correctly but not brand-colored on its
// own. This story is the one place that gets to say "and here, brand it".
//
// Sets `--color-primary` DIRECTLY, not `--kai-color-primary` — found live,
// on THIS round: `builder.stories.tsx`'s `ChatPanel`/`DeviceFrame` set
// `--kai-color-primary` on a nested wrapper div expecting it to flow
// through to `--color-primary` (`theme.css`'s `@theme` block declares
// `--color-primary: var(--kai-color-primary, <fallback>)`), the same way a
// REAL emitted construct's host element does. It doesn't, in this
// bare-light-DOM Storybook context: that `var()` indirection is resolved
// once, wherever `--color-primary` itself is DECLARED (`:root`/`:host`) —
// setting `--kai-color-primary` on a plain descendant div never re-triggers
// that resolution, so the accent color picker in the existing `Labs/Apps`
// Builder story has never actually recolored the preview (confirmed by
// screenshot: the accent swatch reads #e91e63, the composer's send button
// and the widget FAB both render neutral black regardless). That's a
// pre-existing gap from earlier rounds, out of scope to fix here — flagged
// in this round's report instead of silently patched. The one-line, honest
// workaround for this NEW story: skip the indirection and set
// `--color-primary` itself, which — being a plain custom property with no
// further indirection between here and the illustrations/Card classes that
// read it — inherits normally and actually renders.
// Paired with its own foreground: overriding `--color-primary` alone leaves the
// theme's near-white/near-black on magenta at 4.02:1 / 4.20:1, under WCAG AA's
// 4.5:1 for normal text (it failed builder-header.stories.tsx's axe run).
// hsl(45 4% 5%) measures 4.84:1. Same constant as `apps/builder/App.tsx`.

 * The two-step flow for a template family with a real second screen —
 * Workspace, per the owner's ruling this round: a family gets a second
 * screen only once it has >=2 genuinely different starting points, and
 * Workspace's own owner-feedback round shipped exactly two (an artifact/
 * code pane beside chat, v0's shape; a full app preview with device
 * toggles, Lovable's shape — see `components/builder/builder-workspace-variants.tsx`'s
 * own module doc comment for the "why not a third card" reasoning re:
 * Multi-mode's "Switchable views").
 *
 * ADDED HERE, in `Labs/Builder/Start`, rather than as a new top-level Labs
 * sidebar entry — this story is a CONTINUATION of the Start flow (picking
 * "Workspace" advances into it), not an independent screen someone would
 * navigate to directly, and Storybook already groups every export under one
 * `title` together in the sidebar, so a reader on the Start page finds this
 * one story below it for free.
 *
 * Selecting a non-Workspace card advances straight to a stub readout naming
 * the template, same as every other template already does
 * (T-6: each has its own full story under `Labs/Builder` to route to,
 * out of scope for this flow demo). Selecting "Workspace" advances to
 * `WorkspaceVariantPicker`; picking a variant there shows which family +
 * variant id fired — an honest STUB rather than mounting the real
 * `Labs/Builder/Workspace` story's own demo component, which is
 * module-private to that file and not designed to be re-parented into a
 * second story. Back returns to step one with the original selection
 * preserved.
