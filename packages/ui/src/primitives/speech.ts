/**
 * Browser SpeechSynthesis mechanics, shared by `VoiceOutput`
 * (components/voice/voice-output.tsx) and the message action bar's built-in
 * 'speak' action (primitives/message-feedback.ts) — ONE implementation, per
 * B-7's "back it with the existing kai-voice-output/SpeechSynthesis
 * mechanics". Free, local, no provider — no invoice concern.
 *
 * Every raw `window.speechSynthesis` access lives HERE, each wrapped in its
 * own `hasSpeechSynthesis()` guard, so `voice-output.tsx` (whose `stop()` is
 * reachable from `onCleanup`) never touches the global directly. That is not
 * just tidiness: `tests/components/teardown-without-dom-globals.test.tsx`
 * statically resolves a teardown callback's call graph PER FILE (it does not
 * follow an imported callee into the module that defines it) and recognizes
 * a guard only when the guarding predicate's body is walkable in the same
 * file as the raw access — so the guard must live beside the access it
 * protects, not just be callable before it.
