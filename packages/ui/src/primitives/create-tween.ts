// Matches motion's named curves so the visualizers feel like their LiveKit

//
// Every easing here is TOTAL: it clamps `t` into [0, 1] itself rather than
// trusting its caller. `cubicBezier` already did (its Newton solve needs `t`
// in range to converge); `linear` was the bare identity and passed anything
// straight through. `step()` below clamps the top but not the bottom, so a
// frame timestamp EARLIER than the origin `to()` captured yields a negative
// `t` and, through an unclamped easing, a tween that runs backwards.
//
// That timestamp cannot occur in a browser -- requestAnimationFrame's
// timestamp and `performance.now()` share a time origin per spec -- so this is
// robustness, not a live bug. It does occur under vitest + jsdom, where the
// two do not share an origin. The clamp lives in the easings rather than at
// the `step()` call site so the tests can drive a negative `t` through each
// curve individually and prove which ones guard.
