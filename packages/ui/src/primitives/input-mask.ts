// src/primitives/input-mask.ts
// Tier 2, the stateful half: one `HTMLInputElement` driven through the pure format engine
// in `field-mask.ts`. Framework-agnostic -- no Solid, no DOM beyond the one input and its
// document. Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-24-form-field-formats-design.md
// (§2 tier 2, §3, and the §5 improvement list, which is binding here).
//
// THE FORMATTED TEXT IS `input.value` (spec §2). There is no overlay and no ghost layer,
// so the caret, selection, find-in-page and every mobile affordance are the browser's own.
// What this module adds on top is: interception, normalization, a caret that never rests
// inside a literal run, its own undo stack (a programmatic `.value` write destroys the
// native one), and a stated clipboard policy.
//
// Four rules hold this file together; each is one of the §5 improvements and each is the
// reason some obvious-looking shortcut is not taken:
//   1. `commit` is the ONLY writer of `el.value`, the selection, the undo stacks and the
//      callbacks (§5.5). The reference this was derived from repeated that sequence in five
//      places and they had already drifted apart.
//   2. `beforeinput` is the interception point WHERE IT IS CANCELABLE; where it is not, the
//      longest-common-prefix/suffix diff in `input` reconciles whatever the browser did
//      (§5.1). Both paths end in `applyEdit` -> `commit`, so there is one edit semantics.
//   3. Between `compositionstart` and `compositionend` this module does NOTHING: no cancel,
//      no `.value` write, no caret move, no clamp (§5.2). Cancelling mid-composition breaks
//      the composition outright, and Android word suggestion is far more common in these
//      fields than CJK input.
//   4. `.value` is never shadowed with `Object.defineProperty` (§5.8). The canonical value
//      is read through `getCanonicalValue()`; the web-component facade will publish it with
//      `setFormValue()`.
//
// ONE KNOWN IMPRECISION, recorded rather than papered over. An undo entry's selection is
// read from the element at commit time. On the `beforeinput` path that is exactly right --
// the event was canceled, so the caret has not moved yet. On the `input` diff fallback the
// browser has ALREADY moved it, so the entry stores the post-edit caret against the
// pre-edit text: undoing a browser-driven edit restores the correct text with a caret that
// is merely plausible. Recovering the true one means caching the selection from
// `selectionchange` and trusting that it fires before `input`, which is browser-timing
// dependent and unverifiable in jsdom -- a guess dressed as a fix. The caret is clamped, so
// it is never out of range. Task 6 can measure the real ordering and decide.

  /** ONE clamp function, idempotent, NO TIMERS (§5.9) -- but four triggers, and the trigger

   *  `mousedown`+rAF / `mouseup`+`setTimeout` pair and the keyboard-driven selection it
   *  missed; it is not an objection to listening for more than one event, and an earlier
   *  version of this comment asserted that `selectionchange` alone covered everything. It
   *  does not. Measured in real Chromium (tests/e2e/input-mask-ivp.spec.ts, scenarios 9-10),
   *  logging every candidate event with the offset it saw:
   *
   *    Home  -> ["el:keyup@0"]
   *    click -> ["el:selectionchange@4", "doc:selectionchange@4", "el:mouseup@0", "el:click@0"]
   *
   *  Two facts fall out, and both were live defects the owner hit on a guided field:
   *    - A KEYBOARD caret move fires NO `selectionchange` whatsoever. Home, End and the
   *      arrows reached the clamp on no engine, which is exactly "I could only go back to
   *      the start of ####" failing to hold. `keyup` is the event that does fire.
   *    - A CLICK fires `selectionchange` early, and then the browser applies its own
   *      pixel-derived offset AFTER it -- note the `@4` from our clamp being replaced by the
   *      `@0` visible at `mouseup`. Clamping only on `selectionchange` gets overwritten by
   *      the very gesture it was reacting to. `mouseup` is where the offset is final.
   *
   *  So: `selectionchange` (the general case), `keyup` (keyboard), `mouseup` (pointer), and
   *  `focus` -- the last because a selection that does not CHANGE fires nothing at all, so a
   *  field entered while its caret is already at 0 would otherwise render with the caret
   *  inside the literal prefix and never get a chance to be corrected. Every trigger is the
   *  same idempotent call that early-returns when the selection is already legal, so firing
   *  several times for one gesture costs a comparison and changes nothing. */
  /** "Is the caret in THIS field?" -- asked of the element's own root, never of the
   *  document.
   *
   *  `document.activeElement` RETARGETS: for a focused node inside a shadow tree it reports
   *  the OUTERMOST host, so on any element this kit actually ships the answer is `<kai-chat>`
   *  and never the input. `el.ownerDocument.activeElement !== el` was therefore true on every
   *  trigger, and the whole clamp early-returned -- the caret discipline was dead in the
   *  ops-console app (input at `kai-chat` shadow -> card -> `kai-form` shadow) while passing
   *  in Storybook, whose story mounts the input into a FLAT document where the two agree.
   *  Measured in that app on the dist build (m11-diagnose.mjs), focusing the `CHG-####`
   *  field:
   *
   *    el:focus            docActiveIsEl=false  docActive=kai-chat  rootActiveIsEl=true

   *    doc:selectionchange docActiveIsEl=false  docActive=kai-chat  rootActiveIsEl=true
   *
   *  All four triggers FIRE at the right offsets through two shadow roots -- the trigger
   *  table above holds unchanged; it was only this guard that was wrong. `getRootNode()` is
   *  read per call rather than captured, because the element can be moved between roots, and
   *  it degrades correctly: in a flat document the root IS the document, and while detached
   *  the root is a fragment with no `activeElement`, which reads as not focused. */
