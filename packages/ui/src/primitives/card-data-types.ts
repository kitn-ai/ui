// src/primitives/card-data-types.ts
// The five built-in card PAYLOAD types — `CardEnvelope.data`, one per card type —
// authored beside the schemas they mirror rather than inside the components that
// render them.
//
// THE FOURTH INSTANCE OF ONE DEFECT, AND THE LAST ONE THAT WAS LEFT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` (card-tags.ts), `CardComponentMap` (card-component-types.ts)
// and the tag map before it were each pulled out of a `.tsx` for the same reason,
// and each header says so. Read card-tags.ts first; this is the same problem one
// layer further out, and the reason it is worth a fourth file rather than a fourth
// exception is that these are the types a BACKEND names, which makes them the ones
// with the least business living under a Solid component.
//
// `tsconfig.mcp.json` is Node-only — `lib: ["ESNext"]`, no `jsx` — and a type import
// still has to RESOLVE even though it erases. While `ConfirmCardData` and friends
// lived in components/confirm-card/confirm-card.tsx, any Node/no-DOM project that named one got
//
//   error TS6142: Module '../../components/choice-card' was resolved to
//   '.../src/components/choice-card/choice-card.tsx', but '--jsx' is not set.
//
// measured on this tree, and `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` — the server-safe entry that
// exists precisely so a route can hand a model tool definitions — could not
// re-export them at all without dragging the Solid tree into that pass. So the one
// language the kit is AUTHORED in was the only one that could not name the contract
// it publishes: Python and Go read `./schemas/*.json` and get the full shape, while
// a TypeScript backend building a card envelope got `data: unknown`.
//
// Relaxing tsconfig.mcp.json is not the alternative, and that is measured rather
// than recalled: granting it `jsx: "preserve"` + `jsxImportSource: "solid-js"` takes
// it from 0 errors to 130 on this exact case (838 without the import source, and
// card-tags.ts records 1364 for the broader one), almost all `TS2304: Cannot find
// name 'HTMLDivElement' / 'window'`, because a `jsx` setting drags the whole Solid
// component tree into a Node-only pass. The Node/no-DOM boundary is load-bearing.
//
// WHY THEY ARE `type` ALIASES AND NOT `interface`S — DO NOT "TIDY" THIS BACK
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the other half of the same story and it is not a style preference.
// TypeScript gives an object TYPE ALIAS an implicit index signature and gives an
// INTERFACE none. Measured, both directions, on a two-line file:
//
//   interface IFace { a: string }
//   type    TAlias = { a: string }
//   const r1: Record<string, unknown> = iface;  // TS2322: Index signature for type
//                                               // 'string' is missing in type 'IFace'
//   const r2: Record<string, unknown> = alias;  // OK
//
// Every card element's `data` prop is a `Record<string, unknown>` at some point in
// the chain — the generated `web-component-types.d.ts` used to declare it that way
// outright, and `renderType` in scripts/_ts-helpers.mjs still emits exactly that
// string as its cycle placeholder when it inlines a self-referential type (which
// `FormField` is). So as interfaces these types were not assignable to the very
// property each one's own doc comment tells a consumer to assign it to:
// `el.data = myChoiceCardData` was TS2322 while `<kai-choice>`'s JSDoc said "Import
// `ChoiceCardData` from `@kitn.ai/ui` for the full shape".
//
// Aliases fix that at the root instead of at each of the four call sites, and they
// are what makes `FormDefinition` work at all: it is self-referential, so the
// generator can only inline it down to a `Record<string, unknown>` placeholder, and
// an interface would fail against that placeholder no matter what the web components
// declare.
//
// Nothing here merges declarations, so the one capability `interface` has that
// `type` lacks is not in use.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MAY CONTAIN
// --------------------------
// Types only, and only types with no DOM and no Solid below them. It must stay
// importable from a Node process with no `jsx`, which is the whole point; the
// discriminating check is `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.mcp.json` on a tree with no
// `dist/` present, and nothing else is evidence for it. `CardEnvelope` below comes
// from ./card-contract, which is already a `.ts` for the same reason.
//
// Each component re-exports its own types from here, so every existing importer of
// `components/confirm-card` etc. is unaffected, and `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` exports
// them too so a backend route can finally name what it is building.

   *
   * NOT the JSON Schema `format` keyword, and deliberately not an extension of it:
   * `format` has a registered vocabulary with assertion semantics, `widgetFor()`
   * already switches on it to pick a widget, and `toJsonSchema()` turns it into a
   * validation pattern. This is a UI hint, so it lives in the `x-kai-*` namespace
   * with the other UI hints — and it selects FORMATTING, never a widget.
   *
   * Typed as the semantic-type union for a consumer authoring a form definition by
   * hand. A value arriving from a MODEL is untrusted and may be anything at all;
   * `resolveFieldMask()` degrades an unrecognised one to an unmasked text field with
   * a console warning rather than trusting this declaration.
   *
   * SPELLED OUT HERE RATHER THAN IMPORTED, and that is not laziness. `FieldSemanticType`
   * is declared in `./field-semantics`, which carries the semantics TABLE and its
   * `console.warn` — and this file's whole reason for existing is that a Node/no-DOM
   * backend can name a card payload with `lib: ["ESNext"]` and `types: []`, where
   * `console` does not exist (measured: TS2584, by
   * `tests/schemas/card-data-types-node-safe.test.ts`, which is what caught the import).
   * A type import still has to RESOLVE, so importing the union would drag the engine into
   * the server-safe entry's graph.
   *
   * AN APP CANNOT PIN THIS ON THE MODEL TODAY.
   * `cardTools({ require })` narrows a projected tool schema by dot-path, but there is
   * no path that reaches a form FIELD: a form card's payload is itself a JSON Schema, so
   * `form.schema.json` describes `properties` as a map of field definitions rather than
   * as a node per field, and `require: { form: [{ path: 'properties.ticketId' }] }` is a
   * TypeError naming a path that does not resolve. "Force the model to mask the ticket
   * field" is therefore not expressible; the enum above is what makes it LIKELY, and an
   * app that needs a guarantee validates the arriving envelope itself.
   *
   * It is therefore a REGISTERED COPY of `FIELD_SEMANTIC_TYPES`: the two are pinned
   * mutually assignable at compile time in
   * `tests/components/form-field-formats.test.tsx`, so adding a fifth token to the enum
   * without adding it here fails `nx typecheck ui` rather than shipping a form card that
   * cannot name it.
