 * How an attachment is DRAWN, derived from what the wire can do with it.

 * ★ THIS IS NOT A LIST OF MEDIA TYPES, and that is the whole point. It used to
 * be one in disguise (`image | video | audio | document`, decided by a prefix
 * switch in `attachments.tsx`), and it disagreed with `wire/media-types.ts` in
 * both directions: SVG and MP4 drew a convincing preview that then threw at
 * encode time, while PDF and text — the formats the wire handles best — drew
 * the same anonymous icon as a `.zip`. `getMediaCategory` now asks the media
 * policy and returns what it says, so there is one declaration and this is a
 * projection of it.
 *
 * `image` / `document` / `text` ARE `EncodableKind` from `wire/media-types.ts`.
 * They are spelled out rather than imported because this module is deliberately
 * JSX-free and dependency-free for the framework-neutral consumers; the runtime
 * agreement is pinned by `attachment-media-policy.test.tsx`, whose drift guard
 * derives both sides from the policy.
 *
 * `video` and `audio` are GONE on purpose. No wire this kit ships can carry
 * either, so they were categories whose only job was to make an unsendable file
 * look sendable; both now land in `unsendable`.
