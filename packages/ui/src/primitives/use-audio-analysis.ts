 * radial.tsx:142-144 -- radial's loPass was 80 until their PR #1265). Their
 * HOOK's own default is 100-600 (useTrackVolume.ts:95-101), but no shipped
 * component uses it, so parity means matching the components.
 *
 * At fftSize 2048 that is ~2.34-4.69kHz at 48kHz (2.15-4.31kHz at 44.1kHz):
 * the sibilance band, ABOVE where a room's noise floor lives. Everything at
 * or below -100dB normalizes to exactly 0 (see normalizeDb), and a real
 * room's tone measures ~17dB BELOW that floor across this window while
 * sitting ~27dB ABOVE it across 86-258Hz (noise-floor diagnosis, table A).
 * The narrow high window plus the hard -100dB floor IS upstream's noise
 * gate -- there is no explicit gate anywhere in their pipeline -- and it is
 * what keeps their idle bars perfectly still where a wide window shows the
 * room breathing.
 *
 * The trade, measured on a real un-processed recording ("this is a test,
 * testing one two three, hello world"): through 100-200, quiet
 * natural-volume speech frames read all-zero (54% of that clip's frames;
 * consonants and sibilance still register on the louder ones). Upstream
 * lives with that because their input is conditioned before analysis -- an
 * agent's loud TTS track, or a local mic captured with autoGainControl +
 * noiseSuppression + echoCancellation + voiceIsolation (livekit-client
 * defaults.ts:27-30) that lifts speech toward target level. Ours follows:
 * the mic stories request the same constraint set. For RAW input where that
 * trade reads wrong (un-gained recordings, music), `loPass: 4, hiPass: 120`
 * (86Hz-2.6kHz: fundamental + first two formants) remains the measured
 * opt-in -- it read those same quiet frames at mean 0.234 with only true
 * silence at zero -- at the documented cost of visualizing the room's noise
 * floor on the centre elements (the defect that reverted this default).
