/** Observe an element's resizes but report the FULL rendered document height (not the

 *
 *  Used by the remote-card provider runtime to size the host iframe:
 *  `observeContentHeight` reports the ResizeObserver content-box of
 *  the observed root, which drops that root's OWN padding/border and any ancestor
 *  (e.g. `<body>`) padding above it; the host then clips the bottom of the card by
 *  exactly those lost pixels. `scrollHeight` is the full padding-box height as actually
 *  rendered, so it stays correct no matter which element in the ancestor chain carries
 *  the padding/border, including if the provider page's own styles change later.
 *
 *  Deliberately `document.body.scrollHeight`, NOT `document.documentElement.scrollHeight`:
 *  the CSSOM View spec special-cases the
 *  scrollHeight of the ROOT element to be `max(viewport scrolling area, viewport
 *  height)`, and the host sets the iframe's viewport FROM this very measurement
 *  (`host-embed.ts` `sizeIframe`), so `documentElement.scrollHeight` can only grow for
 *  the life of the frame: once the iframe is tall, the root's own scrollHeight is
 *  floored at that height even after the card's content shrinks. `<body>` carries no
 *  such floor; its scrollHeight is a plain padding-box measurement of body's own
 *  content, so it shrinks along with the card. */
