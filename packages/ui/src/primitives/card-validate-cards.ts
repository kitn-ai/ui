// src/primitives/card-validate-cards.ts
// Two-tier validation of a CardEnvelope's `data` against the card schema for its
// type, for the NATIVE dispatchers.
//
// "The card schema for its type" means one of the seven built-ins, OR a schema the
// app registered for a card type of its own. The second half arrived with
// `createCardRegistry` (src/schemas/registry.ts) and is the optional third argument
// to `validateCardData`. It exists because a developer's real generative UI is THEIR
// pricing table, not our confirm card, and a validator that covers only the built-ins
// leaves the one card the app actually cares about as the only unchecked one.
//
// THIS MIRRORS src/remote/provider-runtime.ts:139-147, DELIBERATELY.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// The remote (iframe) transport has validated every incoming envelope since the card
// contract landed: `validateAgainstSchema(renderer.schema, envelope.data)`, and on
// failure it renders a placeholder and emits `{ kind: 'error', cardId, message }`.
// The native path (the Solid `<CardRenderer>` and `<kai-cards>`) checked only that
// the TYPE was registered, so the same bad payload was caught in an iframe and
// rendered silently in-process. That asymmetry is what this file closes. The two
// transports are one behaviour; if you change the shape of the failure here, change
// it there too, and say so.
//
// WHY THIS IS ENFORCEMENT AND NOT A SAFETY NET
// --------------------------------------------
// The intended design was that `strict: true` tool definitions would constrain the
// model so envelopes arrived valid by construction. Measured against both providers'
// current strict subsets (see src/schemas/provider-subsets.ts), strict mode cannot
// express ANY of the seven card types today: `form`'s free-form `properties` object
// collapses to `{}` under the mandatory `additionalProperties: false`, and the other
// six trip `minLength`/`maxLength`/`format: "uri"`/`allOf`. So the schema guides the
// model and does not constrain it, and this check is the only thing standing between
// a wrong shape and the user's screen.
//
// WHY THE TIERING IS NOT POLITENESS
// ---------------------------------
// This library is pre-1.0 and already in use. Cards that render acceptably today
// must keep rendering, or turning validation on is a behaviour break dressed up as a
// fix. So a failure that means the card has NOTHING to render replaces the card with
// a diagnostic (hard), and a failure that means the card has content which is merely
// out of bounds renders the card and reports (soft). Both emit `{ kind: 'error' }`,
// because the developer needs to hear about both; only one changes what the user sees.
//
// THE SOFT TIER IS ON BY EVIDENCE, NOT BY CONFIDENCE
// --------------------------------------------------
// The plan (2026-08-11-emit-contract.md §9 risk 4) said validation is net-negative if
// it fires on cards that render fine today, and set the bar at ZERO before the soft
// tier could default on. That was measured, not assumed:
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-soft-tier-corpus.md.
//
// 35 card envelopes recorded from five model configurations across both wires, six
// card types. ZERO trip the soft tier; zero trip the hard tier. The check was proven
// live on that same path by seven negative controls (real envelopes mutated into each
// tier's named failure, each required to trip), and a fifth of the envelopes were
// confirmed by replaying them through the real app and reading them back off
// `<kai-thread>.messages`. Margins were wide, not marginal: the worst `link.title`
// observed was 21 characters against a 300 limit.
//
// What that corpus does NOT cover, so it is not claimed: the structured-output path
// (model-authored envelope JSON, which nothing clamps), live `artifact` cards, and
// the soft constraints the spike's own tool projection clamps before they can be hit
// (`tone`/`provider` enums, the generated `id` fields, every `minItems`). If the soft
// tier ever does turn out to be noisy, that is where to look first, and the fix is the
// projection rather than the tier.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY CHECKED
// ------------------------
// The keyword coverage is `validateAgainstSchema`'s, which is a lean subset: `type`,
// `const`, `enum`, `required`, `properties`, `items`, the numeric bounds,
// `minLength`/`maxLength`/`pattern`, `minItems`/`maxItems`/`uniqueItems`. It has no
// applicators and no `additionalProperties`. The consequences are written out per
// keyword in scripts/gen-card-validation-schemas.mjs's NOT_ENFORCED table, and the
// generated projection repeats them at the top of card-validate-schemas.ts. The
// short version, because it bears on what may be claimed: an `embed` missing both
// `id` and `url`, an `artifact` with neither `src` nor `files`, a `link.url` that is
// not a URL, and an undeclared extra property are all NOT caught here.

/**
 * Keyword to tier.
 *

 * card because the dispatcher does not know what any given card component does with
 * a field.
 *
 *   hard  the field the card is built around is absent, or is a different kind of
 *         thing entirely. There is nothing to draw.
 *   soft  the field is present and of the right kind; there is just too much of it,
 *         too little, or it is outside a declared range. Something renders.
 *
 * THE TWO ENTRIES THAT ARE JUDGEMENT CALLS, RECORDED BECAUSE THEY ARE ARGUABLE:
 *
 * `minItems` is HARD while `minLength` is SOFT, and they look like the same shape.
 * The difference is what is lost. `confirm.actions` has `minItems: 1`, so violating
 * it means a decision card with no decisions: the entire interactive surface is
 * gone, and what renders is empty chrome that looks like a bug in this library. The
 * plan names that case specifically as the one the diagnostic exists for. Violating
 * `minLength: 1` on `actions[].label` means ONE blank button label; the button is
 * still there, still focusable, and still emits the correct `id`. Replacing a whole
 * card with a diagnostic over one blank label is the worse outcome for the user.
 *
 * `type` is HARD everywhere, including on optional scalars where a truthy wrong type
 * would have rendered fine (`dismissible: "yes"`). That is deliberately blunt. A
 * per-field carve-out would need the dispatcher to know which fields each card
 * component treats loosely, which it cannot, and a wrong `type` is the single
 * strongest signal that the model produced something other than what was asked for.
