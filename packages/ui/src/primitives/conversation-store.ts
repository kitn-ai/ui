/**
 * The conversations data contract (C-3, C-5, C-7): a JS-property interface,
 * never REST/events baked into the format. The kit owns the interface, the
 * payload types (ConversationSummary/ConversationGroup from ../types,
 * ChatMessage from ../web-components/chat-types — reused, never duplicated), and
 * the lifecycle (list() on mount + list-view open, load() on row select,
 * save() on message-array change). The dev owns invocation, retrieval,
 * transport, auth, retention.
 *
 * Two built-ins ship: localStorageStore (auto-wired for history: local) and
 * fetchStore (the recast of codegen.ts's emitHistorySetup endpoint behavior —
 * same key shapes, same x-kai-user-id header, same decide-loudly failure
 * mode, now reusable instead of inlined per-construct).
 *
 * Reachable two ways, deliberately: the package root (bundler consumers) and
 * the self-contained `@kitn.ai/ui/stores` entry (dist/stores.js, zero bare
 * imports) for no-bundler/CDN pages, which cannot load the solid-importing
 * root bundle — see src/stores/index.ts for the decision record.

   *  has no real signal for. `localStorageStore` implements it below.
