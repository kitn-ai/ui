// That last clause is the load-bearing part: it is why `V-***` works, where a
// character-class strip reads the literal `V` as user input (see normalizeToRaw).

/** Raw (fill-position-only) characters extracted from arbitrary input, with
 *  positional literal consumption and case folding: literals are matched leniently.
 *
 *  LITERALS ARE MATCHED WHERE THEY SIT -- this is the fix for a real defect, and both halves
 *  of it are watched failing in the test file. A strip-then-fill normalizer (drop every
 *  non-alphanumeric, then fill positions in order) turns a pasted `V-123` under `V-***` into
 *  raw `V12`, rendered `V-V12`: the literal `V` is alphanumeric, survives the strip, is eaten
 *  by the first fill position, and the `3` falls off the end -- silently. Consuming only a
 *  leading literal RUN fixes that one case and leaves the same shape alive one level deeper:
 *  under `*-V-*`, `A-V-B` puts the interior literal `V` into the second fill position and
 *  drops the `B`. So the walk below advances over the FORMAT, not over a stripped string,
 *  and every literal -- leading, interior or trailing -- gets its chance to claim the input
 *  character sitting in front of it.
 *
 *  The two branches, and why lenience is safe here:
 *  - At a LITERAL, an input character equal to it (case-insensitively) is consumed as that
 *    literal. A character that is not equal means the input simply omitted the literal, so
 *    the format advances and the input does not -- which is what lets `chg4821`, `v123` and
 *    a bare `AB` all normalize correctly.
 *  - At a FILL, an input character of the right class is taken (folded per `caseMode`) and
 *    both advance. One of the wrong class is discarded and the position WAITS for the next
 *    one -- that is what absorbs separators, spaces and the browser's autofill formatting
 *    (`chg 4821`, `CHG-4821`, `chg4821` all give the same raw).
 *
 *  Every iteration either consumes an input character or advances the format, so it
 *  terminates. Input past the last fill position is clipped -- the caller compares lengths
 *  to report `over-capacity`. */
