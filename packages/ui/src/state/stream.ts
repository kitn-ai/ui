/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Bag exclusivity: why the mutators below do not just take their payload type.
 *
 * `Source`, `Partial<ToolPart>` and `ReasoningOpts` are WEAK types — not one
 * required field between them — and TypeScript only excess-property-checks
 * OBJECT LITERALS. Hand a mutator a VARIABLE and that check never runs, so any
 * bag sharing a single optional key name flows straight in. `addSource(source:
 * Source)` therefore accepted an `AttachmentData` and a `CardEnvelope`, and
 * `addFile(a) { inner.addSource(a); }` compiled clean at exit 0 while writing a
 * file payload into a `source` part. Nine such pairs existed across these three
 * bags and not one of them was a type error; `./stream-types.test.ts` pins all
 * nine, and fails with nine "Unused '@ts-expect-error'" if this guard is lifted.
 *
 * Tightening the PAYLOAD types is not available. A citation with no url and no
 * title is a rendered, tested state (`citationTitle` in components/message/message.tsx
 * falls through title -> url -> a generic word, and message.stories.tsx ships
 * "a citation with no url at all"), and a patch/opts bag is optional by
 * definition. So the exclusivity lives on the PARAMETER instead, which leaves
 * every published data type — and every artifact generated from them — alone.
 *
 * The forbidden key set is DERIVED from the `MessagePart` union, the same
 * derivation `verify:scaffold` and `lint:silent-drops` read, so a seventh
 * variant re-fires this on its own rather than quietly widening the hole.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY — three things this deliberately does NOT cover. Each is a
 * decision with a reason, not an unfinished edge; they are collected here so
 * the whole boundary reads in one place instead of being met one at a time.
 *
 * 1. A KEY NO SIBLING BAG OWNS still passes. `Unmixed` is a denylist over the
 *    sibling vocabulary, not an exact type, so a consumer's own superset of a
 *    citation — `{ url, title, relevance }` — keeps compiling. Full exactness
 *    would catch marginally more and push real callers toward a cast, and a
 *    cast to `Source` from an attachment is the original bug. A guard people
 *    route around is worse than a narrower guard they keep.
 *
 * 2. `addCard` / `addFile` ARE NOT WRAPPED. Both take STRONG types —
 *    `CardEnvelope` requires type+id+data, `AttachmentData` requires id+type —
 *    so ordinary assignability already does what `Unmixed` exists to do for a
 *    weak bag. Measured, not assumed: wrapping `addCard` buys ZERO (no sibling
 *    bag is assignable to `CardEnvelope`, because nothing else carries `data`).
 *    Wrapping `addFile` buys exactly one pair — `addFile(c)` with
 *    `c: CardEnvelope<'file', unknown>` — and costs two ordinary consumer
 *    shapes, since the derived denylist owns `state` and `index`:
 *
 *        { id, type: 'file', filename, state: 'uploading' }  // upload progress
 *        { id, type: 'file', filename, index: 3 }            // display position
 *
 *    That one pair needs a hand-written generic narrowing with no other
 *    purpose; an ordinarily-inferred `CardEnvelope` is ALREADY rejected.
 *    Rejecting likely code to block contrived code is the wrong trade — the
 *    same trade point 1 refused. Both facts this rests on are pinned in
 *    ./stream-types.test.ts, so it re-opens if either stops holding.
 *
 * 3. A HAND-BUILT PART BYPASSES ALL OF IT. `parts.push({ type: 'source',
 *    source: attachmentVariable })` compiles, because these mutators are not
 *    in the path. Closing it means intersecting the guard into `MessagePart`
 *    itself — and `docs/web-components.md` and `llms-full.txt` inline that
 *    union's fully-expanded structural text, so dozens of consumer-facing
 *    prop-table rows would grow `type?: undefined; state?: undefined;
 *    data?: undefined`. That cost lands on every consumer reading the docs
 *    while the benefit reaches only someone who has already stepped around
 *    the provided API. The mutators are the supported path; they are guarded.
 *    This is where the supported path ends, not a gap in it.

  /** Settles the turn as FAILED and puts `reason` where the reader can find it.
   *
   *  WHERE THE REASON LANDS, in order:
   *  1. every tool part that has NOT produced a result flips to `output-error`
   *     with `errorText: reason`, so no panel spins forever. A tool ALREADY in
   *     `output-error` with its own non-empty `errorText` is left exactly as it
   *     is: "search index offline" is the answer to what went wrong and
   *     "Connection lost." is the generic outer symptom, so overwriting the
   *     specific with the generic loses the only actionable thing on the
   *     message. It still counts as carrying the failure. A tool in
   *     `output-error` with NO text does get filled in — an error panel with
   *     nothing in it says no more than a blank bubble does.
   *  2. if no part was able to carry it, the reason is APPENDED as its own text
   *     part.
   *
   *  Never both — a turn does not report the same failure twice.
   *
   *  "Where the reader can FIND it" is deliberate, and rule 1 and rule 2 are not
   *  equally loud. Rule 2 is text in the thread: read without any interaction.
   *  Rule 1 is a tool panel, which renders COLLAPSED — the header shows an error
   *  icon and a badge, so the failure is unmissable, but the `errorText` itself
   *  is one click away. That is the right default for a failed tool inside an
   *  otherwise readable answer, and it is why rule 2 exists rather than always
   *  stamping the panel and calling it reported.
   *
   *  Rule 2 is the whole point and it used to be missing. `abort` only ever did
   *  rule 1, so a TEXT-ONLY turn — every turn of a text-only support widget —
   *  had nothing to stamp: the string was discarded and a failed request
   *  rendered an EMPTY assistant bubble, while the consumer that passed a
   *  perfectly good sentence believed it had reported the failure. That is the
   *  repo's "decide loudly" rule broken on the one path where being quiet is
   *  worst, and it shipped because the discard is invisible from the call site.
   *
   *  It is a NEW part, never a merge onto the trailing text: gluing "Connection
   *  lost." onto the model's half-finished sentence reads as the model saying
   *  it. Text that already streamed stays exactly where it is.
   *
   *  The reason is TRIMMED, and `abort()` with no reason — or one that is empty
   *  or all whitespace — appends nothing: there is no reason to discard, and the
   *  kit will not invent copy the consumer did not write. Rule 1 still runs,
   *  with `errorText: undefined`. Whitespace is not a pedantic case here: the
   *  scaffold hands over `err.message`, and an `Error` is free to carry `''`,
   *  which would otherwise render an INVISIBLE text part — a blank bubble that
   *  also claims to have said something.
   *
   *  Settled is settled: after `done()` or a first `abort()`, this is a no-op
   *  like every other mutator, so the reason cannot be appended twice.
   *
   *  The reason is CONSUMER-facing text and is rendered as markdown like any
   *  other text part. Pass a sentence a visitor can read, not a stack trace. */
