// lint-comment-references: long-block -- the mock's contract: the five tells and the constraints are what every string below must satisfy
// The mock responder: the zero-config first win.
//
// `createMockResponder()` returns a function producing a STREAM SOURCE (SSE frames in the
// OpenAI chat-completions shape) that the caller hands to `readOpenAIStream` exactly as it
// would hand over a `fetch()` Response. No network, no key, no provider.
//
// WHY A WIRE RATHER THAN FOLDING PARTS DIRECTLY: folding text deltas onto `parts` (what
// the scaffolder and all five starters used to do, in seven copies) BYPASSES the kit's own
// parser on the one code path every new developer runs first, and it makes the mock and
// real scaffolds structurally different, so swapping in a backend becomes a rewrite rather
// than `mockResponse(value)` -> `await fetch('/api/chat', …)`. The frames are the OpenAI
// shape because the mock stands in for the consumer's `/api/chat` ROUTE, not a provider.
//
// A MOCK MUST BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM A REAL RESPONSE. This repo shipped the opposite once:
// a scaffold seeded a fabricated tool call, the panel rendered it as Completed, and the
// fabricated turn was POSTed ahead of the user's own message. So the tells below are
// deliberate and layered, one per altitude: the raw stream, every frame, the field level,
// and the turn level.
//   1. RAW STREAM — the first bytes are an SSE comment banner (`: kai-mock …`).
//      Comment lines are dropped by `sseDataFrames`, so this is free
//      semantically and unmissable to anyone reading the stream or a capture.
//   2. EVERY FRAME — carries `_kai_mock`, a full sentence naming this function.
//      The OpenAI reader ignores fields it does not know, so it costs nothing
//      and it survives JSON parsing: logging any single frame shows it.
//   3. FIELD LEVEL — `model` is `kai-mock`, which is not a model any provider
//      serves. If a mock frame were ever echoed back upstream it would be
//      REJECTED rather than quietly accepted, which is the specific failure the
//      fabricated-tool-call bug needed and did not get.
//   4. TURN LEVEL — usage is all zeros. A real turn that produced text cannot
//      report zero completion tokens, so `turn.usage` disambiguates in the app,
//      not merely in the bytes.
//   5. UI LEVEL — the reply says so in words. The WEAKEST tell and the only one
//      a real model could imitate, which is exactly why it is not the only one.
//
// CONSTRAINTS
// -----------
// Zero dependencies, no DOM, no Solid, no network, and nothing that is not a
// global in both Node and the browser (`setTimeout`, `JSON`). This module is
// part of `@kitn.ai/ui/state`, which is import-safe on a server — see
// `verify:ssr`. It deliberately does NOT import from `@kitn.ai/ui/wire`: it
// yields `AsyncIterable<string>`, which is structurally a `StreamSource`, so the
// dependency runs one way (a caller pairs them) and `state` keeps its charter of
// owning no wire format.
