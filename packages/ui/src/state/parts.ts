 *  WHY THE KEY IS A PAIR. A block index alone is NOT unique inside one `parts`
 *  array. Anthropic numbers content blocks per MESSAGE and restarts at 0 on the
 *  next one, while a tool loop folds every round into a single assistant turn.
 *  Keyed on index alone, round 2's thinking block (index 0) merges into round 1's
 *  part: the text concatenates and `raw: opts.raw ?? cur.raw` OVERWRITES round 1's
 *  verbatim provider payload with round 2's. `toAnthropicMessages` then emits one
 *  thinking block where two belong, carrying round 2's signature in round 1's
 *  position -- a modified-and-filtered thinking block, which is exactly the 400
 *  the verbatim `raw` channel exists to prevent.
 *
 *  `streamId` is the namespace: one value per provider response stream, attached
 *  by `consumeModelStream`. Two rounds are two streams, so their index 0s are two
 *  parts. Producers that drive a sink from a single stream can omit it; `undefined`
 *  is its own namespace and behaves exactly as before.
 *
 *  Returns the SAME array reference when the merge produces an identical part,
 *  for the same reason `upsertToolPart` does: a new `parts` array is the
 *  re-render signal, so handing one back for a delta that changed nothing is a
 *  spurious render.
 *
 *  An EMPTY delta is not a no-op and must still reach here: it is how a redacted
 *  reasoning block, a `signature_delta` and an assembled `content_block_stop`
 *  block arrive, and how a format opens a block at the right position so block
 *  ORDER survives into `parts`. Those carry a new `raw`/`signature`/index and so
 *  compare unequal and DO rebuild. What the check absorbs is the other empty
 *  frame: one carrying nothing new, which a provider is free to send repeatedly.
 *
 *  `signature` and `raw` resolve with `??`, so an explicit `undefined` from a
 *  later delta never blanks a value an earlier one established. Pass a DEFINED
 *  value to replace either; there is no way to clear them. */

 *    which costs one extra re-render and never a wrong render.
 *  - `input` and `output` are the two fields that are genuinely object-shaped:
 *    reference equality first, then `fingerprint()` as a structural fallback so
 *    a fresh-but-identical object still dedupes.
 *  - everything else, including `rawInput`, compares with `===`. `rawInput`
 *    against `!==` is exactly the test we want (did the accumulated text
 *    change?) and it is cheap: two strings of different lengths are unequal
 *    after the length check, so it never walks the full string.
 *
 *  This replaces `fingerprint(merged) === fingerprint(cur)`, which serialized
 *  the ENTIRE ToolPart on every patch. A streaming tool call is patched once
 *  per argument fragment while `rawInput` grows toward the full argument JSON,
 *  so hashing the whole part per fragment is quadratic in the argument size:
