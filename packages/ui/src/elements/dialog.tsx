/**
 * `<kai-dialog>` — a centered modal: a dimmed backdrop over the page with a
 * centered panel of arbitrary content. It is the real primitive behind the kind
 * of modal that settings panels and broadcast composers reach for.
 *
 * **How to use** — slot the body, and optionally a `header` and `footer`:
 * ```html
 * <kai-dialog open>
 *   <h2 slot="header">Broadcast a message</h2>
 *   <textarea placeholder="What's on your mind?"></textarea>
 *   <div slot="footer">
 *     <button onclick="this.closest('kai-dialog').hide()">Cancel</button>
 *     <button>Send</button>
 *   </div>
 * </kai-dialog>
 * ```
 *
 * The default slot is the body; `header`/`footer` are optional regions with
 * dividers. The backdrop dims the page; clicking it (or pressing Escape) closes
 * the dialog. Focus moves into the panel on open and is restored on close, and a
 * basic Tab focus trap keeps keyboard focus inside while open.
 *
 * The dialog is always named: a projected `header` becomes its `aria-labelledby`,
 * and otherwise `label` becomes its `aria-label` (defaulting to `Dialog`). The
 * header wins when both are present, since ARIA ranks `aria-labelledby` first.
 *
 * Open state is the standard disclosure surface: settable+reflecting `open`,
 * `kai-open-change`, and `show()`/`hide()`/`toggle()`; seed with `default-open`.
 * It also exposes `focus()` to move focus to the panel. Parts: `backdrop` ·
 * `panel` · `header` · `body` · `footer`.
