// src/elements/cards.tsx
// <kai-cards> — the web-component list dispatcher. Renders one child kai-* element per
// envelope (by type→tag), propagates its theme, and routes children's bubbling
// `kai-card` events through an optional `policy`. The raw events keep bubbling past
// <kai-cards> (composed) so document-level listeners still work. Unknown types render
// the Solid CardFallback inline and emit a contract `error`.

   *  Typed `Record<string, object>` rather than `Record<string, JsonSchema>`
   *  deliberately: an imported `.json` schema widens `"type"` to `string`, and an
   *  authored one carries `$schema`/`title`/`description`/`additionalProperties`,
