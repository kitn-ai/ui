// Labs/Builder/Build wait — the screen the builder shows while a construct's
// preview boots. It replaces one line of small text, which the owner called
// boring and non-inspiring and asked to be something that depicts BUILDING.
// The approved shape (their idea, signed off after scoping): a NON-INTERACTIVE
// blueprint assembly — the chosen template's own drawing assembling itself —
// with the real boot phases reported underneath. The game idea was explicitly
// dropped: a game turns a wait into something to watch instead of something
// to get through.
//
// Story-first, like every round on this branch: nothing here is wired into the
// builder page yet. This file IS the design surface for that review, so it
// shows one story per template blueprint (the drawing differs per template, so
// there is no single story that reviews the thing), plus the two states that
// are not the happy path — reduced motion and a boot failure.
//
// The wait is REAL: a first run installing dependencies is minutes. So each
// story here advances its own phases on a timer, at roughly the pace a warm
// boot moves, and then STOPS on the last phase and stays there — which is what
// a long boot looks like, and the state worth staring at while judging whether
// the screen holds up at three minutes as well as at three.

// only re-resolves where `--color-primary` is declared, so setting it on a
// descendant never reaches the accent. The component itself stays token-only.
// Paired with its own foreground: overriding `--color-primary` alone leaves the
// theme's near-white/near-black on magenta at 4.02:1 / 4.20:1, under WCAG AA's
// 4.5:1 for normal text (it failed builder-header.stories.tsx's axe run).
