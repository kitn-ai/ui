/**
 * The theme wire payload shared by the theme studio and the builder host:
 * the ONE type both sides of the postMessage handshake import, so a key
 * renamed on either side is a compile error rather than a silently-empty
 * seed (the shape mismatch that shipped: the builder posted the construct's
 * nested `{ accent, tokens: { light, … } }` while the studio read the flat
 * keys, so a saved theme never seeded and the studio opened on kit defaults).
 *
 * The CANONICAL wire shape is FLAT: `light` / `dark` / `radius` / `fonts` at
 * the top level, in every direction (kai-theme-init, kai-theme-change,
 * kai-theme-apply). The construct FILE nests the same four fields under
 * `theme.tokens` (beside `theme.accent` / `theme.mode`); the builder owns the
 * fold in both directions: `initThemePayload` (apps/builder/App.tsx)
 * construct → payload before posting init, `themeFromPayload` payload →
 * construct on every change, and the studio's `applyHostTheme` additionally
 * tolerates a nested init defensively.
 *
 * Token keys are the `--kai-*` knob names. Root-scope knobs (`--kai-text-*`
 * rungs, `--kai-tracking`, `--kai-shadow-color`) ride in `light`, matching
 * the exported CSS where they sit on `:root`; `dark` carries the dark colors.
