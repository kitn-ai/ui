// import inside a test body: it pulls in ~90 element modules, so the transform
// cost blows the unit project's strict 5000ms per-test budget (it is paid during
// COLLECTION here, which that budget does not govern); and the install has to
// happen as an import side effect for this test to be testing the real thing.
//
// It lives in its own file for the same reason: hook.test.ts asserts that
// importing the hook module installs NOTHING, and a side-effecting import at the
// top of that file would make the assertion meaningless.
