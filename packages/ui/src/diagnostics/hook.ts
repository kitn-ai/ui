// The recorder hook: `window.__KAI_DEVTOOLS_HOOK__`.
//
// The panel floats free of the kit: CDN-delivered, arriving whenever the page gets to
// it, and a LATE SUBSCRIBER by design. This is the object it attaches to: drain the
// history, then stream live. Unlike React's hook, which must install before React loads,
// ours is inside the kit, so it is present as soon as the kit is -- which is the whole
// reason the buffer exists.
//
// TWO BRANCHES, decided ONCE, SYNCHRONOUSLY, at install. Synchronous is a hard
// requirement: an async answer means an interval of "unknown", which forces a permanent
// ring buffer with a size nobody can choose well.
//
//   NOT WANTED -- no buffer, no subscription, so `wireDiagnosticsActive()` stays false and
//   emission remains a guarded no-op. The hook is still installed: a few bytes carrying
//   `activate()`, which lets a panel attach later.
//
//   WANTED -- capture from the first event, uncapped, before the panel exists; once it
//   attaches the panel owns retention.
//
// SSR: no `window` or `localStorage` at module scope, so it never starts server-side.
