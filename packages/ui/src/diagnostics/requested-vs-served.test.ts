// "You asked for Claude, the response says gpt-4o."

// The devtools spec asks for this finding and nothing in the kit could produce
// it, because the two halves live on opposite sides of the transport: the
// REQUESTED model is in a body the kit never sees, and the SERVED model comes
// off the response stream. `reportRequest` supplies the first half; `wire.frame`
// already carried the second.
//
// ★ THEY ARE TWO INDEPENDENT FACTS THAT A PANEL COMPARES, AND NEVER RECONCILES.
// The spec's rule -- "never derive one from the other, and render served as
// absent when the stream did not say" -- applies to the requested half too. A
// display that filled either gap from the other would agree with itself in
// exactly the mismatch case the pair exists to catch.
