// `reportRequest` — the app hands over what it actually sent.
//
// ★ THE ONE THING IN THIS STREAM THE KIT DOES NOT OBSERVE FOR ITSELF.
//
// Everything else here is the kit reporting on its own work: it parsed those
// frames, it encoded that thread, so it can describe them without being told.
// The request that leaves the app is different in kind. In the normal shape the
// app's SERVER ROUTE adds the system prompt, chooses the model, and performs any
// RAG or guardrail injection, and none of that passes through the kit at all --
// which is exactly why `encode.request.systemMessages` is always 0. That 0 is
// the kit saying "the system prompt is being added somewhere I cannot see".
//
// This is the seam for making that somewhere visible, and it is DELIBERATE
// DISCLOSURE rather than collection. The kit does not wrap fetch, does not
// monkey-patch anything, and never reads a request the app did not hand over.
// That is not caution, it is the scope rule: what a request contains, and
// whether an observer may see it, is a decision that lands in the app's own
// policy document. The kit decides HOW a disclosure is shaped -- metadata by
// default, content behind the payload switch, credentials never -- and the app
// decides WHETHER to make one.
//
// It is also why this producer is public while `emitWireDiagnostic` stays
// internal, which otherwise looks inconsistent. A general emitter lets a
// consumer forge any event and make a panel lie about a stream that never
// happened. This one emits a single type whose entire content is "what the app
// says it sent" -- and on that subject the app is the authority, so there is
// nothing here to forge.
//
// SSR-safe: no `window`, no `document`, nothing global at module scope. An app
// that reports from a server route is a normal caller, not an edge case.

/**
 * UTF-8 byte length of the body AS IT WILL BE SENT, or nothing.

 * counts follow: measuring means materializing the whole body, and unlike a
 * one-off cost this recurs on every turn for as long as a subscriber is
 * attached. With payload on the body is being handed over anyway.
 *
 * ★ IT IS REPORTED ONLY WHEN IT CAN BE KNOWN EXACTLY. The trap this exists to
 * avoid: `JSON.stringify` turns a `Blob`, a `FormData` and a `ReadableStream`
 * all into `"{}"`, so a FormData carrying a 40 MB upload reported `bytes: 2`.
 * That is literally "the byte length of the body as JSON" and it is read by
 * every panel as "how big was this request" -- the confident-number class this
 * stream refuses everywhere else, and worse than the em dash it replaces. A
 * typed array was further out still: `Uint8Array(64)` stringifies to
 * `{"0":0,"1":0,...}` and reported 439.
 *
 * Four cases can be answered exactly, and they are answered:
 *
 *   · a STRING -- it IS the body, so its encoded length is the number;
 *   · anything DECLARING a JSON form (plain object, array, `toJSON`) -- that
 *     declaration is what will be stringified onto the wire;
 *   · a BLOB or FILE -- `size` is the byte length, known in O(1). Reporting it
 *     is measurement, not estimation, and refusing would discard a true fact;
 *   · an ARRAYBUFFER or a view over one -- `byteLength`, same reasoning.
 *
 * Everything else is OMITTED, which reads as "not reported" under the absence
 * rule: `FormData` (whose real size needs the multipart boundary walked),
 * `ReadableStream` (whose size is not knowable without consuming it, which
 * would destroy the request), `URLSearchParams`, a `Map`, a class instance
 * declaring nothing. A false negative here is safe; a confident wrong number is
 * not.
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` is also not total -- a circular body, a BigInt, a throwing
 * getter -- and a diagnostic must never be the thing that breaks a request, so
 * that case omits the key too.
 *
 * Cross-realm caveat, stated rather than hidden: a `Blob` from another realm (an
 * iframe) fails `instanceof` and is omitted. That is the safe direction, and
 * duck-typing `.size` to fix it would re-open the `{ size: 999999 }` hole.
