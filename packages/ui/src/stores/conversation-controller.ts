/**
 * The headless conversation controller (P-5, blocks-and-parts spec
 * 2026-08-31; spike finding F-3): the ~60 lines of drift-prone glue every
 * composed app rewired by hand around a `ConversationStore` - active-id
 * tracking, mint-id-on-first-turn (the C-6 lazy-id rule), save-per-turn,
 * auto-restore, and the three-leg "seen" rule for `markRead` - shipped ONCE,
 * framework-free, so the facade (Phase 2's `kai-chat` refactor) and every
 * block run the SAME policy instead of independently drifting copies. The
 * spike's fine-grain rebuild (research/2026-08-31-composition-spike/
 * cdn-widget-src/fine.js) is the reference glue this factory replaces.
 *
 * DISCIPLINE: plain JS closures over the `ConversationStore` contract. No
 * solid imports, no DOM, no framework - the same rule that made
 * `state.js`/`wire.js` loadable raw off a CDN in phase 2. This module ships
 * in `dist/stores.js` (the self-contained entry; `verify:cdn-entries` fails
 * the build on any bare import), so a no-bundler page reaches it by raw URL.
 *
 * THE POLICY, behavior by behavior (each pinned by its own unit test):
 *
 * - C-6 lazy id: no conversation id exists until the first message is saved.
 *   `saveTurn([])` is a no-op; the first non-empty `saveTurn` mints an id
 *   (crypto.randomUUID by default, `mintId` to override) and keeps it.
 * - Save per turn: the consumer calls `saveTurn(messages)` after each turn
 *   settles; the controller saves, refreshes the summary cache (so unread
 *   badges move even for conversations nobody is looking at), and marks the
 *   active conversation read when it is currently seen.
 * - Auto-restore: `restore()` loads the most recent conversation (byRecency,
 *   the ONE recency rule) and hands its messages to `onMessagesLoad`. Guarded:
 *   a no-op when something is already active or the store is empty. The
 *   caller decides WHEN (typically on mount, only while its own thread is
 *   still empty - the controller cannot see the caller's message array).
 * - The three-leg seen rule: a conversation counts as seen - and gets
 *   `store.markRead` called for it - only while ALL THREE legs hold: the
 *   host is open (`setOpen`), the chat view is showing (`setView('chat')`),
 *   and it is the active conversation. `seen()` exposes the derived value;
 *   each leg's transition into the seen state fires `markRead`, as does a
 *   turn arriving while seen holds. Any single missing leg suppresses it.
 * - Unread derivation: `anyUnread()` folds `isConversationUnread` (the one
 *   public read of `lastReadAt`) over the cached summaries, excluding the
 *   active conversation ONLY while it is seen - the exact rule ChatThread
 *   applies, so a message landing on the active conversation while the host
 *   is closed still raises the badge.
 * - Decide loudly: a failed `save`/`markRead`/`list` is console.error'd (or
 *   handed to `onError`) and degrades - never a silent no-op, never a throw
 *   that kills the caller's turn loop.
