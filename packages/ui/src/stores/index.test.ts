/**
 * The `@kitn.ai/ui/stores` entry, imported STANDALONE — the exact usage the
 * entry exists for (a no-bundler page that cannot load the solid-importing
 * root bundle; see this entry's own header for the spike that found it).
 * Behavioral depth for the stores lives in
 * src/primitives/conversation-store.test.ts; this file pins the ENTRY: that
 * it resolves on its own, that it carries every store export the root does
 * (so the two surfaces cannot drift apart), and that what it hands out
 * actually works. The bare-import-free-ARTIFACT half of the contract is
 * scripts/verify-cdn-entries.mjs (postbuild), which this jsdom test cannot
 * see.
