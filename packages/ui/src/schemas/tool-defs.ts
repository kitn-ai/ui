// Card schemas -> provider tool definitions.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
// -----------------------
// A developer who wants a model to produce a `confirm` card today hand-writes a tool
// definition that approximates a schema they cannot import, then hand-writes a mapper
// from the model's arguments back to a CardEnvelope. This repo's own reference
// harness does exactly that and says so in a comment
// (examples/internal/openrouter-spike/src/tools.ts). That is the same shape written
// in five places. This file removes two of them: the tool definition is GENERATED
// from the schema the card already validates against, so it cannot drift.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
// ---------------------
// It is not a provider client and it never becomes one. No `openai`, no
// `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, no `fetch`. The provider envelope shapes below are declared
// here as plain structural types, which is what lets `@kitn.ai/ui` keep its rule that
// nothing under `src/` depends on a provider SDK. The kit PARSES and PROJECTS; the
// consumer FETCHES.
//
// THE HEADLINE, MEASURED, NOT RECALLED
// ------------------------------------
// `strict: true` currently throws for EVERY built-in card on BOTH providers. That is
// not a bug in this file, it is what the schemas say when you hold them against the
// two documented subsets (see provider-subsets.ts for the two source docs). The
// authored schemas use `minLength` (confirm/choice/tasks), `maxLength` +
// `format: "uri"` (link/embed/artifact), `minimum` (tasks/embed/artifact),
// `maxItems` (confirm/artifact), `pattern` (embed), `if`/`then` (embed), `oneOf`
// (artifact), a free-form object (form) and untyped `payload`/`allowOther` members
// (confirm/choice). Non-strict is therefore the default and the mode the
// five-configuration conformance spike actually proved cards in — but since F-20 it
// is no longer a raw pass-through either: a root combinator (`anyOf` on artifact,
// `allOf` on embed) gets HTTP 400 from OpenAI and Anthropic even non-strict, so the
// non-strict projection relaxes those root combinators LOUDLY (constraint restated in
// the description, console.warn names the relaxation, registry.validate still
// enforces at render time). The jsonschema projection stays byte-faithful to the
// authored schema.
//
// The alternative was to silently drop the offending keywords. That is rejected for
// the reason the plan gives: a dropped `maxItems: 4` means the model emits six
// actions and the card renders six buttons, with nothing anywhere saying the contract
// was quietly loosened. A throw that NAMES the card, the path and the keyword is a
// signal on the developer's own machine, which is the whole point.

// THE TOOL NAME IS NOT SPELLED HERE
// ---------------------------------
// `kai_confirm` is produced by `toolNameForCardType()` in ./from-tool-call, which
// also owns the inverse (`cardTypeFromToolName`). Both directions come off one
// string in one module on purpose. If this file wrote `'kai_' + type` instead, the
// two halves could drift, and the symptom would be a model dutifully calling
// `kai_confirm` while the loop's parser looks for something else and routes it to
// `runTool`, where it disappears with no error anywhere.
//
// A `toolPrefix` OVERRIDE IS NOT SHIPPED, AND THAT IS A DECISION.
// The plan reserves `createCardRegistry({ toolPrefix })` for Phase 2. It is
// deliberately NOT stubbed in here, because the inverse hard-codes the `kai_` prefix:
// a `toolPrefix` honoured on this side alone would generate tools the parser cannot
// recognise, which is a worse failure than not having the option. The seam is the
// `CardToolSource` interface below; the override lands in both directions in one
// change, or not at all.
