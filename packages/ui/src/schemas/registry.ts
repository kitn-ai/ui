// createCardRegistry: the one place an app writes down which cards it renders.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT "A WAY TO REGISTER CUSTOM CARDS"
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// Registering a custom card already worked: `chat.cardTypes = { 'pricing-table':
// 'my-pricing-table' }` goes through `mergeCardTags` and has since the card contract
// landed, and `cardTools({ 'pricing-table': schema }, { provider })` already emitted
// `kai_pricing-table` before this file existed. Measured on 4b33cd8, both halves of
// the custom round trip passed already. Nothing here unlocks them.
//
// Two things did not work, and they are what this file is for.
//
// 1. NOTHING TIED THE TWO ENDS TOGETHER. `cardTypes` is a per-web-component PROP, so there
//    is no ambient registry a backend route could consult. The developer wrote their
//    card types on the client, wrote them again in the tool definitions, and nothing
//    made the two agree. This is the fifth-copy problem the emit contract exists to
//    kill, one layer up from the schema itself.
//
// 2. THE MODEL WAS TOLD ABOUT ALL SEVEN BUILT-INS REGARDLESS. `cardTools({ provider })`
//    has no way to say "this app renders confirm and choice, do not offer the model an
//    artifact card". Every request paid for seven tool definitions, five of which the
//    app had no intention of using, and the model could pick one of them.
//
// So the goal is not the seam, which existed. It is to make the NORMAL path go through
// the seam, so it cannot rot the way it did once already: the only end-to-end user of
// `cardTypes` was a workaround in the conformance spike that registered `spike-artifact`
// because the kit had no artifact card, and when the kit grew one the workaround was
// correctly deleted and the coverage went with it. Coverage that exists only because
// something is missing is coverage on a timer.
//
// WHAT `use` DOES AND DOES NOT NARROW
// -----------------------------------
// `use` narrows what the MODEL IS TOLD ABOUT. It does not narrow what renders, and it
// must not be read as if it did. `mergeCardTags`/`mergeCardComponents` union the seven
// built-ins in unconditionally (consumer overrides win), so an app declaring
// `use: ['confirm']` still renders a `choice` envelope if one arrives. That is the
// right behaviour: an envelope that turns up from somewhere else should draw, not
// degrade to a fallback because it was left off a tool list. Narrowing rendering would
// be a `primitives/card-registry.tsx` change, and a worse product.
//
// Likewise `registry.validate()` covers all seven built-ins regardless of `use`.
// Validation is about what ARRIVED, not about what was offered.
//
// NO `toolPrefix`, DELIBERATELY
// -----------------------------
// The plan reserves `createCardRegistry({ toolPrefix })` and this file does not ship
// it, for the reason tool-defs.ts already gives: the inverse (`cardTypeFromToolName`)
// hard-codes `kai_`, so a prefix honoured on the emit side alone would generate tools
// the loop's parser cannot recognise, and the card would vanish into `runTool` with no
// error anywhere. Worse than not having the option. It lands in both directions in one
// change, or not at all.
//
// SERVER-SAFE
// -----------
// This module is imported by a backend route (it is half the point) so it stays free
// of DOM and of the Solid runtime. `CardComponentMap`/`CardTagMap` are TYPE imports
// and erase completely; the values in `components` are passed through untouched and
// never called here. `verify:ssr` imports the built entry under the `node` condition
// and proves the runtime half.
//
// It does NOT prove the compile-time half, and the two imports below are deliberately
// aimed at `.ts` modules rather than at primitives/card-registry.tsx for a reason no
// runtime guard can see. A type import still has to RESOLVE, and a Node/no-DOM project
// (tsconfig.mcp.json: `lib: ["ESNext"]`, no `jsx`) cannot resolve a `.tsx` at all:
// pointing either of these back at card-registry.tsx puts TS6142 on this exact line on
// any unbuilt tree. Both types are re-exported from card-registry.tsx, so importing
// them from there LOOKS equivalent and compiles everywhere else. It is not. The check
// that tells the difference is `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.mcp.json` with no dist/
// present; see the header of primitives/card-component-types.ts.
