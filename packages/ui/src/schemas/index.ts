// @kitn.ai/ui/schemas: the card JSON Schemas, reachable.
//
// The 11 schema documents under src/primitives/card-schemas/ have been copied into
// dist/schemas/ on every build and shipped in every tarball since the card contract
// landed. Nothing could reach them: package.json "exports" is a CLOSED map with no
// `./schemas` key, so both `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` and
// `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas/confirm.schema.json` resolved to TS2307 /
// ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. This repo's own reference harness gave up and
// hand-derived the confirm schema in
// examples/internal/openrouter-spike/src/card-schema.ts, saying so in a comment.
//
// WHY THIS JS ENTRY IS THE PRIMARY SURFACE
// ----------------------------------------
// The raw JSON subpaths ship too (`@kitn.ai/ui/schemas/confirm.schema.json`), and
// they are the right answer for a Python or Go backend, or for `fetch`. They are
// the SECONDARY surface for JS/TS consumers because importing JSON breaks three
// different ways across the framework targets the scaffolder supports: Node ESM and
// TS `nodenext` need `with { type: 'json' }`, types need `resolveJsonModule` in any
// mode, and Workers need a `wrangler` rule. A JS entry has none of those problems
// anywhere, and it picks up `verify:ssr` coverage for free, since that guard derives
// its entry list from the exports map.
//
// SERVER-SAFE, DELIBERATELY
// -------------------------
// No DOM, no Solid, no `fetch`. Everything reached from here is data or plain
// functions, and as of src/primitives/card-component-types.ts that is true of the
// TYPES too: nothing reachable from this entry resolves to a `.tsx` any more, so a
// Node/no-DOM project can read the whole graph from source. (`CardComponentMap` used
// to come from primitives/card-registry.tsx and was the last exception.) This entry
// is meant to be imported by a backend route that hands tool definitions to a model,
// so anything that touches a browser global would defeat its purpose. `verify:ssr`
// asserts the RUNTIME half, by importing the BUILT entry under the `node` condition
// in its own child process; the compile-time half is `tsc --noEmit -p
// tsconfig.mcp.json` on a tree with no dist/, and only that one sees a `.tsx` creep
// back in.
//
// WHAT `verify:ssr` DOES NOT CATCH, MEASURED
// ------------------------------------------
// It checks the BUILT bundle, so it only sees what survives tree-shaking — and
// rollup is good enough here that it does not see the mistake you would actually
// make. Measured, not assumed: pointing the `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` re-export below at
// src/primitives/card-registry.TSX instead of card-tags.ts produces a byte-identical
// dist/schemas.js with zero `solid-js` references, and imports clean under `node`.
// Rollup compiles the whole Solid component tree (build time 0.2s -> 3.9s) and then
// discards all of it, because only the tag map is reachable.
//
// So the `.ts` split is NOT holding a runtime guard up, and must not be described as
// if it were. What it buys is that this entry's server-safety stops depending on
// tree-shaking staying perfect: one module-scope side effect anywhere under
// components/ and the discarded tree stops being discardable. Removing the dependency
// beats relying on it being elided.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHERE
// ------------------------
// dist/schemas.js, measured on this tree, not recalled:
//
//   42,658 B min / 11,762 B gzip   before ./registry landed
//   53,658 B min / 14,669 B gzip   after ./registry  (+11,000 B / +2,907 B gzip)
//   53,864 B min / 14,739 B gzip   now, with BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS  (+206 B / +70 B gzip)
//
// The middle row is this comment's previous "53,656 / 14,667", re-measured rather than
// carried forward; the 2-byte drift is what a claim costs when it is copied instead of
// taken again. The last row is the tag map below, measured by building this entry with
// and without that one export line.
//
// The `18,160 B / 5,800 B` this comment used to claim was measured at 0.20.1, before
// tool-defs and provider-subsets were added to the barrel, and had been stale ever
// since. Corrected here rather than left, because a size claim nobody re-measures is
// the same class of thing as a guard nobody watches fail.
//
// The delta is ./registry plus what it pulls: primitives/card-validate.ts (the
// validator) and primitives/card-validate-schemas.ts (the LEAN projection). That last
// one means the seven card schemas appear TWICE in this bundle, authored and lean.
// Deliberate, and the alternative is worse: validating built-ins against the authored
// documents here while the browser validates them against the projection would be two
// behaviours wearing one name. One function, one answer, 4 KB.
//
// All of it is a SERVER cost and does not touch a client bundle. Nothing in the
// component tree imports this entry, so no consumer pays it unless a route or a
// build script imports it on purpose. If you are here comparing it against the
// ~1 KB gzip figure in the emit-contract plan, those are different things: that one
// is the LEAN projection destined for the browser (descriptions and `$id` stripped,
// validation keywords only), which is a separate artifact and not this file.
//
// NOT RESTATED
// ------------
// Every value below is the JSON file itself, imported and inlined by the bundler.
// There is no hand-copied shape here and there must never be one: `verify:schemas`
// asserts each exported entry is byte-identical to its file on disk, and that the
// two maps between them account for every file in the directory and for nothing
// else. The whole point of this entry is to stop the same shape existing in five
// places.
