// The inverse of `cardTools()`: a model's tool call back into a renderable card.
//
// This is the one line a developer adds to their tool loop:
//
//   for (const call of pending) {
//     const card = cardFromToolCall(call.name, call.input ?? {}, { id: call.id });
//     if (card) {
//       stream.addCard(card);
//       applyToolOutput(stream, call.id, { status: 'awaiting_user' });
//       continue;
//     }
//     applyToolOutput(stream, call.id, await runTool(call.name, call.input ?? {}));
//   }
//
// It replaces the hand-written mapper this repo's own reference harness carries
// (examples/internal/openrouter-spike/src/tools.ts:471-500), whose comment says the
// model cannot emit a CardEnvelope directly because the schemas are unreachable.
// They are reachable now (./index.ts), so the mapper does not need to exist.
//
// RUNTIME-FREE, DELIBERATELY
// --------------------------
// One type import, which erases. No DOM, no Solid, no validator, no schema data.
// This is imported by a backend route inside a tool loop, so it must weigh nothing
// and must not drag `cardSchemas` in behind it.
//
//
// THE TWO DESIGN CALLS, AND WHY
// =============================
//
// 1. THE TOOL NAME CARRIES `type`; THE `tool_call_id` CARRIES `id`.
//
// `kai_confirm` produces `{ type: 'confirm' }`, and the provider's `tool_call_id`
// becomes `CardEnvelope.id` unchanged. The id is not a detail: it is already unique
// per call, and it is already the key `upsertCardPart` (src/state/parts.ts:172)
// matches on. So a model that revises a card re-sends the same tool call id, and
// `AssistantStream.addCard` replaces that card in place instead of rendering a
// second copy of it. Generating an id here would break that for free, which is what
// the spike's `card-${++cardSeq}` does today.
//
// 2. `kai_` DECIDES "CARD TOOL". IT DOES NOT DECIDE "RENDERABLE".
//
// Two questions get asked about a `kai_*` call, and they are answered in two places
// on purpose:
//
//   "is this a card tool at all?"   -> here, from the prefix. Returns null if not,
//                                      so the loop's `if (card)` falls through to
//                                      the app's own tools. Never throws: an unknown
//                                      tool name is ordinary, not exceptional.
//
//   "can this card render / is the  -> the DISPATCHER. An unregistered type already
//    data well-formed?"                renders `CardFallback` and emits
//                                      `{ kind: 'error', cardId }`
//                                      (components/card/card-renderer.tsx:33-42), and
//                                      T1.5 adds the same treatment for data that
//                                      does not match its schema, mirroring
//                                      remote/provider-runtime.ts:142.
//
// So this module has no validator and must not grow one. Two consequences, both
// intentional:
//
//   - A type the kit does not know (`kai_pricing-table`) still produces an envelope.
//     Gating on the 7 built-ins instead would send a custom card type, registered
//     perfectly legally through `cardTypes`/`mergeCardTags`, to
//     `runTool('kai_pricing-table')` which no app implements, and the card would
//     vanish with no diagnostic anywhere. The permissive read costs nothing, because
//     a genuinely unknown type is named on screen by the fallback.
//
//   - Malformed `data` still produces an envelope. Returning null would be
//     indistinguishable from "not a card tool" and would misroute the call to
//     `runTool`; throwing would kill the whole turn, including the sibling tool calls
//     in the same batch, for what the plan explicitly treats as a PRODUCTION failure
//     mode. Keeping the envelope keeps the bad data attributable to the tool call
//     that produced it, which is what lets the app hand the diagnostic back to the
//     model, and the model's corrected retry then upserts over the broken card
//     because it reuses the same tool call id. That healing only works if the
//     malformed call produced an envelope in the first place.
//
// `isCardTool` and `cardFromToolCall` are derived from ONE decision function below,
// rather than each testing the prefix, so they cannot drift into disagreeing about
// the same question.
