/**
 * THE MESSAGE LIST'S KEY, and the reason it is not the message object. This is
 * the canonical note; `thread.tsx` keys its identical list the same way and
 * points here.
 *
 *  `<For>` is REFERENCE-keyed, and a streaming assistant message gets a brand
 *  new object identity on every delta — `createAssistantStream` rebuilds it as
 *  `{ ...prev[i], parts: next }` because a new reference IS the re-render
 *  signal. Keyed on the objects, every chunk therefore looks like an entirely
 *  new list: the whole message row is torn down and rebuilt, and everything the
 *  user did inside it dies with it. Expanding a tool or reasoning panel
 *  mid-stream did nothing at all — the disclosure opened and was discarded
 *  microseconds later by the next token. (`MessageBody` keys its PARTS by
 *  position for exactly this reason; that fix was dead while its parent kept
 *  destroying the subtree above it.)
 *
 *  So key on `message.id`, which is stable across the object churn: `<For>` over
 *  the id array diffs by string value, a delta produces an identical id list,
 *  and no row moves. The row then reads its message through `messages[i()]` —
 *  `<For>`'s index accessor, which it keeps current across inserts, removals and
 *  moves — so the CONTENT keeps updating through accessors while the DOM stays
 *  put.
 *
 *  WHY NOT `<Index>`, the other way to survive the churn: `<Index>` keys by
 *  POSITION, so a row's local state (an open panel, a half-filled form card)
 *  belongs to the slot rather than to the message. Appends and tail truncations
 *  (regenerate/edit) are fine, but prepending older turns — load-earlier-history,
 *  which every real chat grows — shifts every row, and each open disclosure
 *  stays behind with the wrong message. Position IS a valid key inside a
 *  message, where the folds only ever append or patch a part in place; it is not
 *  one for the message list, where the host owns the array and splices it.
 *  Both approaches require the row to read through accessors — that is inherent
 *  in keeping a row mounted while its object is replaced, not a cost unique to
 *  either.
 *
 *  Contract: `id` must be unique per message. It already had to be — the
 *  feedback/copy state above this list is keyed by it.
 */
/** How an ASSISTANT row aligns its parts across the column (K-D11).
 *
 *  `stretch`, not `start`. An assistant turn is a `flex flex-col` box, so under

 *  `min(max-content, column)`. Prose is wider than the column so a text bubble
 *  looked right, and a generative-UI card was as wide as its widest button: the
 *  ops-console parameters form measured 285px inside a 768px column while the
 *  approval card beside it filled all 768. A card in a chat thread filling its
 *  column is a fact about the medium, and no consumer can reach it — the card
 *  element is created inside `<kai-chat>`'s shadow root.
 *
 *  Stretch rather than `w-full` on the cards, for two reasons: it is one lever
 *  instead of one per card surface (the Solid `Card` root AND every `kai-*`
 *  card host, whose shadow wrapper is `display: contents`), and stretching only
 *  applies where the cross size is `auto`, so a part that states its own width
 *  is untouched — `Attachments variant="grid"` stays `w-fit`. `Tool` and
 *  `Reasoning` already asked for `w-full` explicitly; this is the same
 *  intention, applied once.
 *

  // common late-set path on its own; this computed handles the EDGES where
  // the visitor has already navigated:
  //
  // Rising edge: from the untouched default (root chat, no drill) land on
  // 'home'; a list opened under the plain grammar becomes the Messages tab
  // root. A visitor already IN a chat (root or drilled) is never yanked out.
  // Falling edge: `home` turning OFF while on 'home'/'messages' leaves a
  // view name the plain grammar does not have — reset to its equivalent
  // ('chat', re-drilling 'list' when the list was showing).
  //
  // NOT `on(homeEnabled, fn, { defer: true })`: Solid's `on()` skips calling
  // `fn` on its first real invocation but does NOT capture the deferred
  // read as `prevInput` — the first non-deferred call always sees `prev ===
  // undefined` (confirmed against `solid-js/dist/solid.js`'s `on()`, not
  // just inferred), so `!isOn && wasOn` can never be true and the falling
  // edge silently never fires. Track the previous value by hand instead: a
