// `BuildWait` — what the builder shows while a construct's preview boots.
//
// The screen it replaces was one line of small text ("Starting the preview —
// installing dependencies…"). The owner's brief: something that depicts
// BUILDING, non-interactive — explicitly not a game, because a game turns a
// wait into something to watch rather than something to get through.
//
// So: the chosen template's OWN blueprint draws itself into existence, and the
// real boot phases report underneath it. The animation is the mood; the steps
// are the truth. Nothing here fakes progress — the drawing's timing is fixed
// and says nothing about how far along the boot is, and every claim about the
// boot comes from `steps`/`current`/`error`, which the caller owns.
//
// THE 3-SECOND vs 3-MINUTE PROBLEM (a first run installing dependencies is
// minutes; a warm one is seconds), and why it is solved this way:
//
//   The draw-on finishes in about two and a half seconds, then the blueprint
//   HOLDS, fully drawn, with one slow breathing accent on the single shape
//   that is the kit's own chat surface in that drawing. That accent is the
//   only thing still moving after the draw.
//
//   The alternative — looping the draw — was rejected on meaning, not taste:
//   a blueprint that erases itself and starts over reads as "that restarted",
//   which at minute three is the exact wrong message about a process that is
//   in fact still going fine. A held, finished drawing with a heartbeat reads
//   as "the drawing is done, the machine is still working", which is true.
//   The same heartbeat runs on the active step's dot, so the two halves of the
//   screen are visibly on the same clock, and the steps are what actually
//   changes over a long wait. At three seconds you see a thing being built; at
//   three minutes you see a finished plan and a list that is still moving.
//
// REPRODUCED, NOT IMPORTED. The illustrations in `builder-start.tsx` are the
// visual language this uses, and this file does NOT re-invent it — `STROKE`,
// `LINE`, `BORDER`, `ACCENT`, `ACCENT_FILL` and `BLUEPRINT_BG` are imported
// from there, so the stroke weight and the four inks cannot drift. But the six
// illustration COMPONENTS are module-private there and take no props, and a
// draw-on needs per-shape control (a path length, a build group, a delay), so
// the six drawings are restated here as SHAPE DATA with the same coordinates.
// That is a real copy and it is registered as one: if a drawing changes in
// `builder-start.tsx`, the copy here has to change with it. It could not be
// avoided from this file — the illustrations are not exported and
// `builder-start.tsx` was off-limits this round.
//
// STYLED VIA INLINE STYLE, NOT UTILITY CLASSES, for every shape — the same
// constraint `builder-start.tsx` records at its own illustrations: stroke/fill
// utilities appear nowhere else in the tree, so they are not in the checked-in
// compiled sheet and unstyled SVG falls back to solid black. Arbitrary-value
// utilities are avoided everywhere in this file for the reason `captions.tsx`
// records: their JIT emission has been non-deterministic in this repo, so
// anything load-bearing is an inline token style.
