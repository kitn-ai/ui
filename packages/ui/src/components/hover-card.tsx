/**
 * ★ THE TRIGGER IS A TAB STOP WHEN, AND ONLY WHEN, ITS CHILDREN ARE NOT.
 *
 * `onFocusIn`/`onFocusOut` were here from the start and the focus-open path was
 * plainly intended, but the span never set `tabindex`, so the Tab key could not
 * land on it and neither handler could fire on a keyboard. It went unnoticed for
 * as long as it did because `focusin` BUBBLES and every consumer at the time put
 * something focusable inside the trigger — `source.tsx` an `<a>`, `context.tsx`
 * a `<Button>` — so the card opened via the child and the span's own inertness
 * never showed. The first trigger with inert children (an attachment tile: a
 * div, an img, an svg) had no tab stop anywhere in it.
 *
 * Hence delegation rather than an unconditional `tabindex`: adding one always
 * would give every existing consumer TWO stops for one card, which is a worse
 * bug than the one being fixed. The check runs in the ref AND again on every
 * `slotchange`, because slot assignment happens after the ref and a one-shot
 * check calls a not-yet-filled `<slot>` inert (see `hasFocusableChild`).
 *
 * ★ THE FOCUS LISTENERS ARE NATIVE, NOT SOLID'S DELEGATED `onFocusIn`. Solid
 * delegates a fixed set of events from the document and retargets them into
 * component trees; inside these shadow roots that path runs for a PROGRAMMATIC
 * `.focus()` and, in the deeper trees, not for a real Tab. Measured: tabbing to
 * an attachment tile in a mounted `<kai-chat>` left the card shut and
 * `aria-describedby` null while `.focus()` on the same element opened it — so
 * every keyboard user got a tab stop that announced nothing and showed nothing,
 * which is worse than no stop at all. `addEventListener` in the ref does not
 * care how focus arrived. Anything in this kit relying on delegated focus
 * events inside a shadow root is suspect for the same reason.
 *
 * `aria-describedby` is what makes the stop worth arriving at: the card is
 * DESCRIPTIVE, not an action, so the trigger gets no `role="button"` — that
 * would promise an activation that does not exist — and instead points at the
 * content it reveals so a screen reader reads it out.
