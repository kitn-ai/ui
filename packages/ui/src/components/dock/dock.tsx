/* The mobile-only close affordance rendered INSIDE the panel. Hidden by default and

   the panel's own containing block once the narrow-viewport rule below sets it to
   position: fixed.

   The inset is a CONSUMER-OVERRIDABLE TOKEN, same idiom as every other geometry
   value in this file (--kai-dock-width and friends). The dock is content-agnostic —
   it never reads what is slotted into the panel — so it cannot know whether that
   content renders its own trailing controls (a ChatThread header-end slot with
   share/settings icons, say) in the same top-right corner.

   The mobile block below reserves a BAND of the panel's own padding above whatever
   is slotted, sized to this button's own footprint, so nothing paints under this X
   by default -- verified fix (round 1) against a real ChatThread header-end slot
   colliding with it at 375px. Owner feedback on the real widget (round 2): for a
   construct with only a title in the header, that band read as a dead empty strip
   with the X floating alone in it -- "that doesn't look like the empty component
   either, lets do better." The actual fix composes instead of reserving space:
   ChatThread now has its own headerEndContent escape hatch (see its prop doc) so a
   caller puts the close control INSIDE the header row, sharing it with the title --
   zero collision by construction, no band needed. hideClose on this component (see
   its prop doc) then suppresses this built-in X for exactly that case, and the
   band above is scoped to :not([data-hide-close]) so it comes off ONLY there --
   every other consumer (anyone who hasn't opted into hideClose, including a
   hand-authored dock with real header-end content) keeps the band, same as round 1
   shipped, so the collision it fixed stays fixed for them. What remains here for
   that default case is a plain absolute overlay, top-right of the panel, with
   these consumer-overridable inset tokens for the rare case it should deliberately

/**
 * Dock: a corner-docked launcher button with a panel that opens above it.
 *
 * The affordance behind a support widget: a circular button pinned to a corner of the
 * viewport, and a floating panel holding whatever you slot into it. The panel is
 * content-agnostic on purpose, a chat or a form or your own component, and the dock
 * never reads, types or reaches into it.
 *
 * WHAT IT OWNS (all of it non-configurable, because these are facts about the medium
 * rather than preferences):
 *
 * - **Hide semantics.** Closed means `visibility: hidden` + `opacity: 0` + `inert`,
 *   and the panel is NEVER unmounted. `display: none` would leave the panel with no
 *   layout box while closed, so anything inside that measures itself (a thread
 *   scroller or a `ResizeObserver`) measures zero and re-measures on every open. The
 *   cost of keeping the box is that a stream keeps rendering into a closed panel,
 *   which is precisely what makes an unread dot honest.
 * - **Focus.** On open, focus moves per `focusOnOpen`; on close it returns to the
 *   launcher, always. `inert` is cleared and visibility restored BEFORE `focus()` runs
 *   (a `focus()` into an inert or hidden subtree is silently dropped, no error), via
 *   a `queueMicrotask`, the same shape `components/dialog/dialog.tsx` uses. Mount moves no focus.
 * - **Escape.** Closes only while the dock CONTAINS focus, and never stops the event.
 *   A background widget that ate every Escape on the page would break the host page's
 *   own menus; swallowing a key from a page you are a guest on is a decide-quietly move.
 * - **No focus trap**, deliberately, unlike `kai-dialog`. The page staying usable is
 *   the whole point of "docked", which is also why the panel is `aria-modal="false"`.
 * - **Mobile close route.** At <=480px the panel goes full-bleed and the launcher
 *   hides while it is open: a floating launcher over a full-bleed panel is not an
 *   obvious close affordance. The panel gets its own `[part="close"]` X, top-right,
 *   CSS-gated by the SAME media query and `[data-expanded]`, so it needs no viewport
 *   JS. Desktop is unaffected: the launcher keeps toggling and no X ever renders.
 *   This is the FALLBACK route, for panel content with no header of its own to hold
 *   a close control: content that does (a `ChatThread` using `headerEndContent`,
 *   say) passes `hideClose` to drop this X instead of stacking a second one over
 *   its own header row.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES: it never aborts a request, never persists its own open state, never
 * decides what "unread" means, and never clears `unread` on open: writing over a
 * consumer's prop is the trap `kai-chat.loading` fell into. Those are the app's calls;
 * `open` + `onOpenChange` is the seam.
 *
 * Geometry is CSS custom properties rather than props: `--kai-dock-width` ·
 * `--kai-dock-height` · `--kai-dock-inset` · `--kai-dock-gap` · `--kai-dock-radius` ·
 * `--kai-dock-z` · `--kai-dock-launcher-size`.
