/** Chrome + sizing around `<Artifact>` for the `artifact` card type.
 *
 *  WHY A WRAPPER IS REQUIRED, not cosmetic. `<Artifact>`'s root is
 *  `flex h-full w-full flex-col` — it is built to FILL a container that already
 *  has a height (a resizable panel, a split view). A message thread gives its
 *  parts no height at all, so `h-full` resolves against an auto-height parent,
 *  the frame computes to ZERO, and the card renders as an invisible nothing.
 *  The explicit `height` here is what makes the card visible; `data.height`
 *  overrides it.
 *
 *  `part`/`data-card-type` are stable handles. `CardRenderer` renders card
 *  components bare, and in the web-component path `cardComponentsFromTags` maps a
 *  non-overridden built-in straight to its Solid component — so there is no
 *  `<kai-artifact>` tag in the DOM to point at. This wrapper is the only stable
 *  thing to select, which is what lets a test count rendered artifacts inside
 *  `<kai-thread>`'s shadow root.
 *
 *  `part="card"` matches the other chromed cards, which get it from `<Card>`;
 *  this one hand-rolls its chrome and so states it directly. The artifact-specific
 *  handle is `data-card-type`, NOT a second part token: every `::part` name has to
 *  be declared in `elements/slots.ts` (the drift guard in `slots.test.ts` enforces
 *  it), so adding an `artifact` part is a deliberate public-API decision to make
 *  there, not something to smuggle in from a component.
 *
 *  `envelope.title` renders as a HEADING above the frame rather than being folded
 *  into `displayUrl`: the address field states where the preview is pointing, and
 *  overwriting it with a title would make it lie. A heading is also what the four
 *  other chromed cards (form/confirm/tasks/choice) already do with `title`.
 *
 *  `tab`/`activeFile` are SEEDS, never re-asserted — see their notes on
 *  `ArtifactCardData`. A revised envelope must not undo what the user did.
 *
 *  The three observation callbacks emit the contract's EXISTING `state` verb —
 *  the contract is frozen, and a new kind would force a CARD_CONTRACT_VERSION
 *  bump. Each patch key mirrors a `data` field name, so a host can merge the
 *  patch straight back into `envelope.data` and re-send it; `addCard` upserts on
 *  `envelope.id`, so that round-trip revises the card instead of duplicating it. */
