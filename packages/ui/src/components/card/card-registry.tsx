// src/primitives/card-registry.tsx
// One source of truth mapping a CardEnvelope.type to a renderer, for both layers:
//   - CardComponentMap drives the Solid <CardRenderer>.
//   - CardTagMap drives the <kai-cards> web component (child kai-* elements).
// Built-ins cover the 7 contract card types; consumers extend/override via a `types`
// prop (merged OVER the built-ins). kai-card (bare shell) is intentionally NOT a target.
//
// THE TAG HALF NOW LIVES IN ./card-tags — AND MUST STAY THERE.
// `BUILTIN_CARD_TAGS` / `mergeCardTags` / `CardTagMap` are plain data with no Solid in
// them, but while they shared this module with `BUILTIN_CARD_COMPONENTS` no Node/no-DOM
// project could import them AS SOURCE, and the `kai` MCP re-derived the map by
// convention as a result. ./card-tags.ts is that data on its own so
// `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` can export it; the re-export below keeps every existing
// importer of this module working unchanged. Do not move them back — see the header
// of ./card-tags.ts for the measured cost of the alternative (0 -> 1364 tsc errors).
//
// THE COMPONENT TYPES NOW LIVE IN ./card-component-types — SAME REASON, SECOND TIME.
// `CardComponent` / `CardComponentMap` are named in the PUBLIC surface of
// `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas` (src/schemas/registry.ts), so a Node/no-DOM project resolving
// that entry's types reached this `.tsx` and hit TS6142. The types went to a `.ts`;
// `BUILTIN_CARD_COMPONENTS` and `mergeCardComponents` stayed, because they are JSX and
// have nowhere to go. Re-exported below, so this module's surface is unchanged.
