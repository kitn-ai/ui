/**
 * Per-state uniform targets, straight from fact sheet section 5's measured
 * table, reconciled against `aurora.glsl.ts`'s own module doc.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION: these same values are upstream's, and upstream's copy is
 * Apache-2.0. They live in `packages/shadcn/hooks/agents-ui/
 * use-agent-audio-visualizer-aura.ts` -- the aura DRIVING hook, which carries
 * no Polyform header and is ordinary Apache-2.0 code, unlike the aura
 * COMPONENT and its inline shader. Every row below matches that hook: the
 * four state rows, the listening spring (1.0s, bounce 0.35), the tween and
 * pulse cadences, and the analyser settings the visualizer feeds from
 * (fftSize 512, smoothingTimeConstant 0.55). Recorded in `packages/ui/NOTICE`
 * as an attribution rather than a port, since no code was copied. This is
 * the BEHAVIOUR layer only -- `aurora.glsl.ts` (the rendering) is original
 * work and owes the hook nothing. See `docs/provenance/aurora-clean-room.md`
 * section 7 for the license map that separates the two upstream files.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `shaderTargets()` (primitives/visualizer-sequences.ts):
 * that helper only carries two axes -- a 0..1 "energy" intensity and a 1..4
 * speed -- built for the OLD custom/aura convention. This shader's real table
 * is non-monotonic across those same two axes (thinking/connecting has LOWER
 * amplitude than idle despite HIGHER brightness) and every value below is a
 * direct fact-sheet pass-through, not a normalized knob, so reusing that
 * helper cannot reproduce it. This shader needs its own mapping, parallel to
 * how `waveTargets()` already exists alongside `shaderTargets()` for the wave
 * shader.
 *
 * `speed` here is fact sheet section 5's `S / 20` (state speed 10..70,
 * divided by 20) -- NOT the raw 10..70 value. `complexity` is `freqParam`
 * directly.
 *
 * `rotation` (deg/s, positive = clockwise ON SCREEN) is NOT from the fact
 * sheet: it is this port's own solid-body trim on top of the wind's
 * emergent angular drift, calibrated offline (a probe replicating
 * `examples/internal/livekit-parity/scripts/aurora-audit.mjs`'s estimator at
 * its capture cadence) so the audit-measured per-state rotation lands on the
 * reference values:
 * speaking ~+17 (their +12.9, Rob's reference ~20 CW), listening ~+4.6,
 * thinking ~+9. The wind supplies most of the apparent motion (post-flip
 * it reads ~+22 CW at speaking, ~0 elsewhere); these trims close the
 * per-state gaps. Like `speed`, rotation is never tweened.
 *
 * Connecting originally carried the probe's -4.7 CCW as a -5.5 trim,
 * flipped to the clockwise equivalent (same magnitude) 2026-08-10
 * (supervisor call, Rob delegated): the direction split came from the
 * screenshot-cadence estimator later shown unreliable (closing-sweep
 * finding: IQR swamps the medians), upstream's hook drives thinking and
 * connecting with identical dynamics, and opposite spins on adjacent
 * transitional states read inconsistent. Single-line revert (connecting's
 * `rotation` below) if the eye test ever disagrees.

  //     it, so a mid-speech pause holds the last voice-driven radius
  //     (silence-hold) until the voice resumes or the state changes -- a
  //     state change re-targets the tween through the effect above.
