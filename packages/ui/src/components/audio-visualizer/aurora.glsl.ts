/**
 * Aurora ("veil") fragment shader.
 *
 * ORIGINAL WORK for @kitn.ai/ui. Written from two inputs only:
 *   1. The project's clean-room "fact sheet" for LiveKit's public "aura"
 *      visualizer look -- a two-team functional spec stating facts and
 *      mathematics only, with no code and no expression and no identifiers
 *      beyond the public prop names and the uniform inventory, both
 *      disclosed in that document's own preamble. What was checked, and how,
 *      is in `docs/provenance/aurora-clean-room.md` section 4.
 *   2. The adopted prototype's own `aura-proto.html` (mode 3, "veil"), which
 *      was itself implemented from that fact sheet by an author who never
 *      saw LiveKit's source.
 *
 * This file is NOT derived from, and was not written with reference to,
 * LiveKit's `agent-audio-visualizer-aura.tsx` or the aura GLSL inlined in
 * it. That component is Polyform Non-Resale 1.0.0, (c) UNCRN LLC -- a
 * license incompatible with publishing this package -- and was never
 * opened. The fact sheet's numbers and formulas (independently re-derived
 * and checked by hand below, not copied) are what stand in for it.
 *
 * Its sibling `use-agent-audio-visualizer-aura.ts`, the DRIVING hook, is a
 * separate matter: that file is Apache-2.0 (repo license, no Polyform
 * header) and carries only the per-state behaviour, not the shader. It
 * contributes nothing to this file; the state targets it describes live in
 * `variant-aurora.tsx`.
 *
 * The construction: 36 phase-offset copies of one ring, each pushed through
 * the same 4-octave directional-sine warp cascade, fused into soft veils by
 * an analytic neighbour-distance blur -- see `auroraWarp` and the strand
 * loop in `mainImage`.
 *
 * One deliberate deviation from the fact sheet: section 1 states the
 * shipped output is "hotter than premultiplied" (written RGB may exceed
 * written alpha), and section 4 confirms the light-mode branch never
 * multiplies RGB by alpha or brightness at all. That is exactly the pattern
 * that produces dark fringes on translucent edges once composited with a
 * `premultipliedAlpha: true` canvas context over a light page background --
 * see the doc on `ShaderCanvas`'s `fragment` prop. This port keeps every
 * other number and formula but replaces the final write with true
 * premultiplied output, `fragColor = vec4(rgb * alpha, alpha)`.
 *
 * PARITY RE-TUNE. A pixel-level behavioral audit
 * (examples/internal/livekit-parity scripts/aurora-audit.mjs) measured the
 * rendered output against the reference and this file was re-tuned to the
 * MEASURED targets -- numbers from screenshots and Rob's reference
 * recording, never from restricted source. Four departures from the
 * original fact-sheet pipeline, all clean-room rendering choices:
 *   1. Wind direction + solid-body rotation: the octave phase runs on
 *      NEGATIVE tau (the audit measured our lobes drifting counter-
 *      clockwise where the reference turns clockwise, ~+13..+20 deg/s when
 *      speaking), plus a per-state `uRotation` trim of the coordinate
 *      frame so each state's measured rotation lands on its reference
 *      value (see `auroraTargets` in variant-aurora.tsx).
 *   2. Dark tonemap is chroma-preserving with a steeper knee (11x/(1+11x)
 *      on the max channel, rescaled) plus an HSV shape-up: hue +0.013
 *      turns, saturation scaled by (1.02 + 0.35 * value) capped at 0.98.
 *      Rendered targets: hue ~197.5deg, saturation ~0.95 rising with
 *      brightness, never white (the audit measured the original
 *      per-channel 4x/(1+4x) map desaturating to ~0.72 and dragging hue
 *      toward green).
 *   3. Brightness is applied through strongly compressive curves
 *      ((b/1.5)^0.07 on colour, 0.97*(b/1.5)^0.09 on alpha, with a
 *      smoothstep alpha knee): the thinking/connecting pulse DRIVES
 *      0.5..2.5 but must RENDER inside roughly 0.5..0.65 mean brightness
 *      (the reference holds 0.53..0.65 where the linear map swung
 *      0.16..0.83 and blinked the ring out entirely at pulse minima).
 *   4. Edge falloff tightened (exp(2.3*spacing), was exp(2*spacing)) and
 *      made asymmetric: the OUTER side of the ring renders at 0.66x the
 *      inner width -- the reference's outer edge is consistently sharper
 *      than its inner one at every volume.
 *
 * Uniforms are declared by ShaderCanvas. Do not declare them here.
 *
 * Uniform contract (the full per-state table is `auroraTargets` in
 * variant-aurora.tsx):
 *   uColor       vec3  -- accent RGB, 0..1.
 *   uIntensity   float -- brightness/gain, fact sheet section 5's
 *                         "brightness" column directly (roughly 0.5..2.5,
 *                         NOT the 0..1 convention other variants use).
 *   uSpeed       float -- octave phase rate in rad/s, fact sheet section
 *                         5's `S / 20` directly (roughly 0.5..3.5).
 *   uComplexity  float -- warp spatial-frequency parameter, fact sheet
 *                         section 5's `freqParam` directly (roughly
 *                         0.4..1.25, default 0.5); mapped internally to
 *                         F = 2 + 13 * uComplexity.
 *   uAmplitude   float -- warp displacement amplitude, fact sheet section
 *                         5's `amplitude` column directly (roughly
 *                         0.5..1.2, default 1.0).
 *   uScale       float -- ring radius, fraction of half-canvas, fact sheet
 *                         section 5's `scale` column directly (0.2..0.3).
 *                         The caller is responsible for folding in the
 *                         instant voice-driven growth
 *                         (`0.2 + 0.2 * volume`, speaking state only,
 *                         fact sheet section 5) before setting this --
 *                         the shader does not read a separate volume
 *                         uniform to avoid double-applying it.
 *   uTheme       float -- < 0.5 selects the dark colour pipeline, >= 0.5
 *                         the light one (fact sheet section 4). This is a
 *                         genuine branch in the math, not just a
 *                         compositing background -- set it from the kit's
 *                         active theme, not a fixed constant.
 *   uRotation    float -- solid-body rotation rate of the whole figure,
 *                         rad/s, positive = CLOCKWISE on screen. A
 *                         parity-calibrated per-state trim on top of the
 *                         wind's own drift (see the module doc above and
 *                         `auroraTargets`); the caller pins it to 0 under
 *                         reduced motion, like uSpeed.
