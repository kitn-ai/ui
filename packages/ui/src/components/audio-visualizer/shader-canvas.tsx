 * without forcing a rebuild -- see `uniformShapeKey` above. This matters

 * frame the volume changes. `fragment` and `precision` are ALSO read through
 * their own memos, not directly, for the same reason: a variant's `precision`
 * is commonly computed from a prop (`size`) that arrives via a dispatcher
 * spread bundling unrelated fast-changing signals (`bands`), so an unmemoized
 * read can mark this effect stale on every one of those, even though
 * `precision`'s resolved value never changes. See the comment above
 * `fragmentMemo`/`precisionMemo` below for the measured failure this caused.
 *
 * Visibility: while the canvas is off screen this canvas RELEASES its WebGL
 * context outright, and takes it back when the canvas returns -- see the
 * `ContextState` block inside the component for the whole mechanism and the
 * context-budget measurement that forced it. There is no prop for this; it is
