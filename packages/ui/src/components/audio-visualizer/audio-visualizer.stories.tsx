 * `bandCount()`, backed by `defaultBarCount`/`defaultGridCount`/

 * array by repeating its LAST value, so a fixed-width generator feeding a
 * variant that wants more bands than that left the extras frozen on
 * whichever value happened to be last, not actually varying.
 *
 * The signal itself models speech, not a waveform demo -- `bandLevel` above
 * layers an utterance envelope (bursts and pauses at syllable/word/sentence
 * rates), a spectral tilt (low bands louder and busier, high bands sparser
 * and quieter), spatially-correlated neighbours (a formant moves several
 * bins at once, not one in isolation), and occasional transients, all built
 * from `Math.sin`/`Math.tanh`/`Math.pow` -- never `Math.abs`, which puts a
 * hard corner at every zero crossing and is a large part of why the previous
 * version read as snappy and mechanical. `seed` gives each call site its own
 * phase offset (see the `SEED_*` constants above) so different variants
 * never move in lockstep. Still a pure function of `t` and band position, so
 * it stays fully deterministic -- no `Math.random()` anywhere in it.
 *
 * Full width and unmirrored, unlike `useVoiceBands` below: its only two
 * callers are wave and aurora, whose shaders consume just the volume
 * scalar the dispatcher reduces from these bands, so band-to-element
 * shape does not apply. (This generator briefly carried an optional
 * `mirror` argument for the DOM-variant overview story that has since
 * been removed; every DOM variant's own story feeds real recorded voice
 * through `useVoiceBands`, which does the half-width-then-mirror properly.)

// The Docs page (tags: ['autodocs'] on `meta`) renders every story in this
// file inline at once. Wave, Aurora, and Custom are six live canvases each,
// plus MicrophoneAll's six: far past Chrome's ~16 concurrent WebGL context
// cap, where surplus contexts do not throw -- they silently fail to
// compile, so tiles render blank while everything looks fine. All three
// stories used to carry `tags: ['!autodocs']` to stay off this page for
// exactly that reason. (`docs.story.inline: false`, which renders a story
// in its own iframe, was measured and does NOT help: same-origin iframes
// share the renderer process, so they share the cap too.)
//
// ShaderCanvas now manages contexts by visibility: it defers building
// until an IntersectionObserver reports the canvas on screen, and releases
// the context (WEBGL_lose_context) when it scrolls away, rebuilding
// through the same setup path on return -- iTime freezes off screen rather
// than resetting. A page therefore holds one context per canvas actually
// in the viewport plus at most one in flight, no matter how many stories
// it hosts, so the cap is no longer reachable by scrolling this page and
// the tags are gone. Expect a one-frame deferred first compile and a two
// to three frame blank on scroll-in; that is the design, not a fault.
