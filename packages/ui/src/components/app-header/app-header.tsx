/**
 * `AppHeader` — the workspace's app-level top bar, PROMOTED from
 * `src/elements/builder-workspace.stories.tsx`'s local `AppHeader`/
 * `ThemeToggleButton` (2026-08-30). That story is the APPROVED DESIGN — the
 * owner's own feedback rounds are recorded in its module comment — and the
 * emitted app had drifted off it (a text "Theme" button, no search at all, a
 * bare avatar with no menu, and the whole cluster stuffed into ChatThread's
 * own header row inside the chat rail). The story now renders THIS component
 * instead of its own copy, exactly as `components/work-surface/work-surface.tsx` did for the
 * pane chrome, so design and product cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS: a top-level strip ABOVE the split entirely (a sibling of
 * `WorkspaceShell`, not inside it), so it persists through the work surface's
 * Expand toggle — mirroring Lovable's own top bar, which lives outside/above
 * its split body. It does NOT replace `ChatThread`'s built-in header row; the
 * story ships both (the app strip across the frame, the rail's own title row
 * inside it) and the emitted app now does too.
 *
 * THE ARRANGEMENT IS NOT CONFIGURABLE — owner ruling, and the reason this is
 * one component rather than a slot bag. Left to right:
 *
 *     [ title ]                    [ search · theme ] | [ actions ] | [ user ]
 *
 *  - the TITLE on the LEFT;
 *  - a utility cluster (search, theme toggle) on the right;
 *  - a divider;
 *  - the header actions row (Share/Deploy in the starters, but a real
 *    construct-authored ordered list — `header.actions`);
 *  - a divider;
 *  - the user cluster, COMPACT: initials avatar + chevron only, no name/plan
 *    text (the owner's own instruction), with the name/plan still feeding the
 *    initials and the accessible name so the control never loses its name to
 *    assistive tech just because the text is hidden.
 *
 * Dividers render only between two groups that both actually have visible
 * content, so switching a group off never leaves an orphan divider.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED HISTORY, recorded so nobody re-litigates it. The FIRST round
 * resolved a contradictory brief ("product title on the right" vs "mirror
 * Lovable's placement exactly", and Lovable's real header puts brand LEFT /
 * actions RIGHT) as a MIRROR of Lovable — actions left, title right — which
 * satisfied both halves of the instruction at once. The owner then ruled
 * explicitly, superseding that judgment call: title on the LEFT, and the right
 * side is the full explicit arrangement above rather than a single actions
 * cluster. Do not "fix" this back toward the mirror; it was already fixed.
 *
 * MENU-HONESTY (this repo's standing rule, and the reason every piece is
 * gated on a MECHANISM and not only on a flag): an affordance with nothing
 * behind it must not render. `showSearch` without `onSearch`, `actions`
 * without `onActionSelect`, `user` without `onUserMenuSelect`,
 * `showThemeToggle` without `onToggleDark` — each renders NOTHING rather than
 * a control that swallows its own click. This is the same shape
 * `WorkSurface`'s `showOpenInNewTab && src` gate takes, for the same reason.
 * Both real call sites always supply the mechanism: the story wires search to
 * its command-palette overlay and reports actions/menu selections in its own
 * preview strip; codegen wires search to the `shell.commandPalette` overlay it
 * emits, the theme toggle to the host's `theme` attribute, and
 * actions/user-menu items to the documented `kai-header-action` /
 * `kai-user-menu` CustomEvents on the host.
 *
 * THEME TOGGLE: icon-only, showing the icon for the mode you would switch TO
 * (Sun while dark — "tap for light" — Moon while light), never "dark mode" /
 * "light mode" text and never the plain text button the emitted app used to
 * render. `dark` is CONTROLLED, never owned here: the story flips a class on
 * its preview frame, codegen flips the host element's `theme` attribute, and
 * this component only reports the click.
 *
 * STYLING follows the same rule as every kit component (Tailwind utilities
 * compiled into the shadow sheet), not the emitted project's inline-style
 * convention — that convention governs the JSX CODEGEN WRITES, which is why
 * composing this component there is what keeps the emitted app on the design.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE CHANGE FROM THE STORY, decided loudly: the strip PAINTS ITS
 * OWN `bg-background`. The story's copy had none and did not need one — it sits
 * inside a preview frame that already paints that exact token. A promoted
 * component has no such guarantee, and the emitted app proved it in the first
 * live capture: above the split, outside `WorkspaceShell` (which paints
 * `bg-background` itself), the strip was transparent, so dark-theme foreground
 * text landed on the page's white. Same token, so the story's look is
 * unchanged; the component just no longer depends on its host for a floor.
