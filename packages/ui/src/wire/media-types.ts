// THE media-type declaration. One table, read by every layer that has an
// opinion about attachments.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Two features want the same knowledge: the
// composer needs to know what a user is allowed to stage, and the encoders need
// to know what they can turn into provider content. Those are the same set. When
// each grows its own copy they drift, and the drift is not theoretical -- it is
// the exact defect one layer down, where a composer happily staged a
// `blob:` URL that the encoder could not represent. So the set is declared ONCE,
// here, and both layers derive from it rather than restating it.
//
// THE BOUNDARY THIS DRAWS. The kit owns "what CAN be encoded" -- a fact about
// `encode.ts`, not a policy. The developer owns "what I want to ALLOW", and can
// only ever NARROW the kit's set, never widen it: widening would just move a
// provider 400 later in the request. That asymmetry is why the filter is a
// declarative list rather than a hook, and why `encodableMediaTypes()` is public.
//
// No I/O, like the rest of `wire/`. Pattern matching and, for text, decoding
// base64 that is already inline -- computation over bytes already in hand, never
// a fetch.

/** What a media type BECOMES on the wire. Named for the Anthropic block set,
 *  which is the narrower of the two: `text` / `image` / `document` and nothing
 *  else. There is no arbitrary-file block on either API, which is why a text
 *  file has to ride as text content and a `.zip` has no representation at all. */

//
// Observed 2026-08-13 (UTC), Chrome 151.0.7922.137, macOS 26.5 arm64, with the
// files handed to a real `<input type="file">` so the browser built every `File`
// itself. Re-run it rather than trusting it:
//   node scripts/probe-file-media-types.mjs
//
//   .txt  text/plain             .js    text/javascript       .png  image/png
//   .md   text/markdown          .css   text/css              .zip  application/zip
//   .csv  text/csv               .html  text/html             .pdf  application/pdf
//   .json application/json       .sh    text/x-sh
//   .xml  text/xml               .py    text/x-python-script
//   .yaml application/x-yaml     .yml   application/x-yaml
//   .ts .tsx .rs .go .sql .toml .log  ->  ""  (the browser could not name them)
//
// THESE VALUES ARE PLATFORM-SPECIFIC. Nineteen of the twenty-two match macOS's
// own `preferredMIMEType`, so the browser is answering out of the OS type
// database and Linux and Windows will answer differently. Nothing returned
// `application/octet-stream` -- Chrome's failure mode here is the EMPTY STRING.
// (`.ts` is not a TypeScript file to macOS: it resolves to an MPEG-2
// transport-stream UTI, which carries no MIME string at all, which is why it
// comes back empty rather than as `video/mp2t`.)
//
// EXACTLY TWO THINGS BELOW REST ON THIS TABLE, and both survive it being wrong
// somewhere else:
//   1. `application/x-yaml` is a row because it was measured here. A platform
//      that says something else does not make this row wrong, only incomplete.
//   2. Seven of the twenty-two extensions are the ones a developer is likeliest
//      to attach to a coding chat, and the browser names NONE of them. That is
//      why an unnamed file is decided by DECODING its bytes and never by reading
//      its filename -- see `decide()`. Another OS moves WHICH rows come back
//      empty; it cannot move the fact that some do.
// Anything else read off this table is being read too hard.

/**
 * ★ THE DECLARATION. Everything else in this file, and both `accept` surfaces, are

 * picker; deleting one narrows both. A second list of media types anywhere in this repo
 * is a defect: delete it and read this.
 *
 * Patterns are HTML `accept` syntax: an exact type (`image/png`) or a subtype wildcard
 * (`text/*`). File EXTENSIONS (`.md`) are deliberately not supported, because they map to
 * media types only by convention and guessing is how a `.md` full of base64 becomes a 400:
 * an extension in a developer's `accept` THROWS rather than matching nothing, and a file
 * the browser could not name is settled by decoding it.
 *
 * On the image list: JPEG, PNG, GIF and WebP are the formats BOTH APIs document; SVG and
 * BMP are the ones people try, and both are a 400 at request time. On the text list,
 * `text/*` is the core and the `application/` rows are textual formats IANA files outside
 * `text/` for historical reasons. YAML has two rows because `application/x-yaml` is what
 * Chrome hands back for a `.yaml` on macOS (measured above) while `application/yaml` is
 * the IANA-registered type (RFC 9512).
