// The wire diagnostic event stream: what the parse pipeline SAW, as metadata.
//
// The kit is the only layer that sees both "frames arrived" and "parts came
// out", so it is the only layer that can tell a wrong-dialect read from a quiet
// one. That fact was previously visible nowhere; this is where it gets said.
//
// METADATA BY DEFAULT, and the rule is checkable rather than a matter of taste:
// if a value comes from the model, the end user, or the app's data, it is
// PAYLOAD; if it describes the shape, size, timing or identity of that value, it
// is METADATA. Every field below is metadata by that rule. `errorCode` yes,
// `message` no -- some providers echo request content back inside the message,
// which is why the code is the half that travels.
//
// PAYLOAD IS A SEPARATE, DELIBERATE SWITCH (`wirePayloadActive`), off by
// default, with its own signal that no URL can set. Every content-bearing value
// lives under ONE optional `payload` key, which is what makes the boundary
// reviewable: a reviewer checks one key rather than re-reading every field
// name, and `payload-boundary.test.ts` asserts it structurally by deleting that
// key and finding nothing left. The one thing that never appears under it
// either is a response URL's query string -- `?api_key=` is a CREDENTIAL, a
// different class from conversation content, and it does not get a switch.
//
// FORWARD COMPATIBILITY, producer side: never repurpose a field name and never
// change what a value means. New information is a new field or a new type.
// Consumers are required to ignore both unknown types and unknown fields, which
// is what lets a CDN-delivered panel float free of the kit's version.
//
// SSR: no `window`, no `Date` and no other global touched at module scope, so
// this imports cleanly anywhere the rest of `wire/` does.
import type { ModelUsage } from './chunk';
// TYPE-ONLY, and that is what makes it legal here. `web-components/diagnostic-events`
// declares interfaces and nothing else -- no imports, no runtime -- so this
// specifier is erased at build and `wire/` acquires no dependency on
// `elements/`. A real one would be a layering inversion AND would drag the
// element bundle into every consumer that only parses streams.
//
// It has to be named from somewhere, because a subscriber receives ONE stream
// and the union is what lets it discriminate on `type` instead of being handed
// an open bag. The alternative -- declaring the element events inside this file
// -- puts element concepts in the wire layer, which is worse.
