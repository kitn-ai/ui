// Real SSE framing, not `split('\n').filter(startsWith('data:'))`:
//   - a frame ends at a BLANK line; multiple `data:` lines join with '\n'
//   - lines starting with ':' are comments (OpenRouter sends
//     `: OPENROUTER PROCESSING` keep-alives) and are dropped
//   - `event:` / `id:` / `retry:` fields are ignored. Anthropic's `event:` lines
//     are redundant: the same discriminator is inside the JSON as `type`.
//   - '\r\n' is normalised
//   - the decoder is incremental, so a socket boundary inside a multi-byte
//     codepoint does not corrupt the text
//
// SSR: TextDecoder is constructed inside the generator, never at module scope,
// and a ReadableStream is detected by duck-typing `getReader` rather than by
// `instanceof`, so this module imports cleanly where neither global exists.

/** Decode an SSE byte stream into JSON payloads, stopping at `[DONE]` and

 *
 *  `[DONE]` stops the YIELDING, not the READING. Returning at the sentinel
 *  unwinds the generator chain while the reader has not yet seen `done: true`,
 *  so `readableToAsyncIterable` treats normal completion as an early exit and
 *  CANCELS the body, and since every OpenAI-format stream ends in `[DONE]`,
 *  that aborts the response on the normal path, one `net::ERR_ABORTED` per
 *  turn. Reading on to EOF instead lets the producer's own close end the
 *  iteration, which is the only thing that makes `drained` mean what it says.
 *  In practice that costs exactly one more `read()`: a server that has sent
 *  `[DONE]` has finished the response body. Frames after the sentinel are
 *  dropped, so what a caller sees is unchanged.
 *
 *  `onRawFrame` is the diagnostics seam: it receives the raw `data:` payload
 *  STRING for each frame that parsed, immediately before that frame is yielded,
 *  because the payload is discarded here and its byte length cannot be recovered
 *  downstream. It is not called for `[DONE]`, for a keep-alive, or for a payload
 *  that failed to parse -- so a caller counting calls counts exactly the frames
 *  it will be handed. Default undefined: with no diagnostics subscriber nothing
 *  passes one in and this is a dead branch. */
