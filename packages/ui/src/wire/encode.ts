/**
 * ChatMessage[] to an Anthropic Messages `messages` array. THE ROUND-TRIP ENCODER.
 *
 * A reasoning block is emitted as `part.raw.payload` verbatim, NEVER rebuilt from text plus
 * signature: Anthropic 400s if a thinking block in the most recent assistant message is
 * modified, reordered, filtered or reconstructed, so a part with no `raw` THROWS. Order
 * follows part order, unfiltered, and an empty-text reasoning part is still emitted.
 *
 * ONE ChatMessage CAN BECOME SEVERAL WIRE MESSAGES, as in `toOpenAIMessages`: the tool result
 * rides in a SEPARATE user message between the two assistant messages, so the turn is SPLIT at
 * each tool boundary:
 *   assistant(pre-tool blocks + tool_use) -> user(tool_result)... -> assistant(answer)
 *
 * Flattening would strand every later round's thinking block in the first assistant message.
 * Consecutive tool parts stay in ONE assistant message, and adjacent user messages are MERGED.
 *
 * `file` parts on a USER turn become `image` and `document` blocks, each taking a base64 or url
 * source, so this wire carries a remote PDF that `toOpenAIMessages` must refuse; on an
 * ASSISTANT turn a `file` part is dropped. `tool_use.input` is a parsed OBJECT, not a string.
