// The encoders' diagnostic ledger: what went in, what came out, what did not.
//
// SEPARATE FROM encode.ts on purpose, and the reason is a guard rather than
// tidiness. `lint:silent-drops` holds every function in `src/wire/` that
// discriminates a `MessagePart` responsible for all six variants, and it is
// right to. Nothing in this file discriminates one: every entry point takes the
// variant as a STRING, read at the call site out of a branch that had already
// discriminated it. So instrumenting the drops cannot introduce a new switch to
// go stale when a seventh variant lands, and the parts that reach `dropped()`
// are typed `unknown` so they cannot be inspected here even by accident.
//
// ZERO COST WITH NO SUBSCRIBER. The encoders build a probe only inside a
// `wireDiagnosticsActive()` branch and reach it through `probe?.`, so with
// nobody listening the whole ledger is one symbol read per encode and a handful
// of skipped optional calls.
//
// SSR: no window, no globals at module scope. The TextEncoder is built on first
// use, the same rule `read.ts` follows.

 * one-off, and unbounded-per-turn is what fails "cheap enough to leave on".
 *
 * THE ALTERNATIVES WERE MEASURED, not guessed, and all three lost: a `charCodeAt` loop is
 * 7x slower on the shape that actually occurs (2.77 ms vs 0.61 ms per 1.4 MB); a native
 * whitespace `.test()` then O(1) arithmetic is exact but identical in time (0.60 ms),
 * because the test is the same full scan; and probing only a prefix for whitespace is 170x
 * faster yet REJECTED, because it assumes periodic line wrapping, so a payload whose only
 * whitespace sits past the probe window is silently OVER-counted. So the resolution is
 * exact-but-gated rather than always-on-but-approximate. `base64-bytes.test.ts` pins the
 * arithmetic against a real decode, so a replacement has to prove it is the same function.
