/**
 * TWO COPIES OF THIS MODULE MUST SHARE ONE EMITTER.
 *
 * Not a hypothetical. The published package shipped `./wire` and `./diagnostics`
 * as separate rollup bundles that each inlined their own copy of this module, so
 * a subscriber registered through one never saw an event emitted by the other --
 * which made the devtools hook inert for every consumer.
 *
 * And it is not only our build config, which is why the fix is a shared global
 * rather than a chunking change: a consumer who bundles the kit and ALSO loads
 * the web-components bundle from a CDN duplicates the module identically, and nothing
 * we do to our own build prevents that.
 *
 * `vi.resetModules()` between two imports is the honest simulation -- the first
 * reference stays alive while the second import evaluates the module afresh, so
 * these really are two independent copies in one process.
