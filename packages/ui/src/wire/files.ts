 * followed by NULs -- is exactly that. This matters most on the path where
 * nothing named the file, because there the decode is the ONLY evidence there is.
 *
 * A NUL-byte heuristic (git's rule for "is this binary") would catch most of
 * them, and it is deliberately NOT here. This same function serves the LABELLED
 * text path, where a host that said `text/plain` has asserted something the kit

 * being wrong the current way sends a block of gibberish the model can see and

 * exists to send and pay tokens to do it. So the body transform is the smallest
 * one that makes the delimiter unforgeable -- the end tag, and nothing else.
 *
 * Left alone, that end tag is a way out of the block. A file containing `</file>`
 * closes it early, and everything after that point reads to the model as the turn
 * AROUND the file rather than as file content: user-supplied bytes in instruction
 * position, reachable by anyone who can get a file in front of the composer.
 * Escaped, it stays where it belongs. `&lt;/file&gt;` ends nothing, and it is
 * visible in the output and reversible by eye, which a deletion or a silent
 * substitution would not be -- a reader who spots it can say exactly what the
 * original byte was. The OPENING tag is left untouched on purpose: it cannot end
 * the block, and escaping it would corrupt every HTML file anyone ever attaches.
