//     seconds each. Split out of `unit` so its 5000ms default stays a meaningful hang
//     detector; see `emitted-code-tests.ts` for the measurements and the budget.
//   • `storybook` — every *.stories.tsx runs as a browser test (play functions,
//     smoke render, and axe a11y) via @storybook/addon-vitest + Playwright.
//
// Run them:
//   npm test                             # all projects (unit + emitted + storybook)
//   vitest run --project=unit            # the fast inner loop

  // On a fresh clone or worktree that made 2 files fail to COLLECT --

  //
  // THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE EXPORTS MAP. It rewrites the specifier for vitest and

  // packages/kai/config/vite/node.ts since the dev tooling moved there. (That

  // dist/schemas.js": it does not, and never did -- every `@kitn.ai/ui/schemas`
  // in mcp/ is an EMITTED-CODE string, not an import.) Neither does any consumer
  // load this file.
  // The consumer resolution path stays guarded by verify:schemas, verify:ssr,
  // verify:tool-schemas, verify:dts / verify:dts:consumer and verify:consumer,
  // every one of which reads the BUILT entry through the exports map from outside
  // the repo. If the `./schemas` key regressed, those still fail; only this run
  // would keep working, and it is not the check that covers them.

        // WHY THIS CONCLUSION IS ROBUST TO ITS OWN CONDITIONS, which matters

        // ~0.73-0.85 cores of steady foreign CPU, two agent sessions and an
        // editor resident. That is the condition which most FAVOURS reducing the
        // worker count, because fewer cores were actually free than the box has
        // -- and reducing it still lost, at every value tested. A
        // genuinely quiet box has more headroom, not less, so it can only widen
        // the default's margin. The direction of this finding therefore does not
        // depend on the box being quiet, which is precisely the assumption that
        // sank the previous number.
        //
        // ON THE OLD MECHANISM. The withdrawn note hedged that nine jsdom forks
        // might thrash the transform pipeline rather than share it, citing
        // aggregate `import` time of 558s across 9 forks versus 255s across 4.
        // Aggregate CPU rising while wall clock FALLS is what parallelism looks
        // like; it is not evidence of harmful contention. The quantity anyone
        // waits on is the wall clock, and it goes the other way.
        //
        // NO VALUE WAS CHANGED in response to this, and none should be. The
        // default stays vitest's default -- now because it measured fastest,
        // not merely because nothing better was known.
        //
        // IF YOUR LOCAL SUITE IS SLOW, fewer workers is the wrong lever: it was
        // monotonically worse here. Measure your own machine instead of copying
        // a number out of this comment --
        //   node scripts/measure-timings.mjs --target=unit --iterations=3 --workers=N
        // -- which records the load average, core count and top CPU consumers
        // around every run, discards runs disturbed mid-flight, and reports
        // min/median/max. A single timing off a box you have not inspected is
        // how the withdrawn advice happened.
        //
        // Independent of the measurement, and still true: a worker count does NOT
        // belong in this config, because it is a fact about one machine's core
        // count rather than about this repo. A hard `maxWorkers: 4` would FORCE
        // oversubscription on a 2-4 core CI runner, and '50%' would halve
        // parallelism there for contention that runner does not have. Leave the
        // repo neutral.

                // The moment it became live it removed WebGL: --disable-gpu alone
                // still leaves SwiftShader ("ANGLE (Google, Vulkan 1.3.0 (SwiftShader
                // Device), SwiftShader driver)"), and the two together leave nothing,
                // so `canvas.getContext('webgl')` returns null. Measured by
                // `node scripts/probe-webgl-under-flags.mjs`, which bisects the list.
                // That is not a crash — audio-visualizer's wave/aurora/custom variants
                // "fall back to bars if WebGL is unavailable", so those stories would
                // go on PASSING while silently exercising the bar path and never the
                // shader path they exist to cover.

                // NO '--disable-features=...' here. Playwright's own defaults already
                // pass one (16 names it disables for test determinism: PaintHolding,
                // Translate, HttpsUpgrades, RenderDocument, ...) and it appends our
                // args AFTER its own, so a second `--disable-features` does not extend
                // that list — chromium keeps the LAST duplicate switch and drops the
                // first, so ours would REPLACE all 16. Verified, not assumed:
                // `node scripts/probe-duplicate-switch.mjs` passes --user-agent twice
                // and the browser reports the second. The two names this used to pass
                // were dead weight anyway: BackForwardCache is already covered by
                // playwright's dedicated `--disable-back-forward-cache`, and
                // CalculateNativeWinOcclusion is Windows-only (CI is ubuntu-latest).
                // NO '--js-flags=--max-old-space-size=2048' either. It was written to
                // "give the renderer more headroom" and measures as the exact
                // opposite.
                //
                // THE LOAD-BEARING EVIDENCE, and the only thing anyone should cite
                // here: `node scripts/probe-heap-cap.mjs` reads
                // performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit straight out of the renderer —
                // 3586 MB without the flag, 2222 MB with it. Chromium's own default
                // ceiling is already ABOVE 2048, so the cap can only make the renderer
                // OOM sooner, which is the mid-suite "Browser connection was closed"
                // crash this block exists to prevent. That is a direct reading of the
                // thing being claimed, and it does not depend on a sample.
                //
                // DO NOT CITE THIS NEXT NUMBER AS THOUGH IT SETTLED ANYTHING. One bare
                // full local run each got 77/115 files through with the flags inert and
                // 57/115 with them live. Suggestive, and consistent with the reading
                // above, but n=1 per side and the bare full run ALWAYS dies eventually
                // on a known per-file harness leak — which is why CI sub-shards via
                // scripts/run-storybook-tests.mjs and never runs it this way. It cannot
                // distinguish anything on its own; it is corroboration or it is noise.
