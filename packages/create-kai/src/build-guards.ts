/**
 * The structural rules `scripts/build.mjs` enforces, as functions a test can
 * call.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS `src/` AND NOT `scripts/build.mjs`, where these lived. Same reason
 * `src/template-guards.ts` exists, and this is the other half of that move.
 * `build.mjs` ends in `main().catch(...)`, so importing it RUNS the build — no
 * test imports it and none can. Every rule inside it was therefore reachable
 * only by running the whole build and reading stderr, which is how a guard once
 * shipped unable to match the one string it was pointed at. The repo's rule is
 * that a check is worth nothing until it has been watched failing; a check with
 * no seam to grab cannot be watched at all.
 *
 * `template-guards.ts` holds the CONTENT rules — what an emitted file is allowed
 * to say. These are the STRUCTURAL ones: is there anything to build, is there a
 * starter behind the row, does a patch still match, is the app where the table
 * claims, do the declared paths exist, do the shared dependency ranges agree.
 * Two files because the two answer different questions and fail for different
 * reasons, not because one grew too long.
 *
 * WHY EACH RULE RETURNS A MESSAGE INSTEAD OF THROWING. The message is the
 * guard's payload — it names the file, states why the rule exists and tells you
 * which table to edit — so it is the thing a test most needs to assert. Throwing
 * would put that text back where only a build run can see it, which is the
 * defect this module removes. `build.mjs` throws what these return, so the
 * output of a failing build is byte-identical to before.
 *
 * WHY THE FILESYSTEM ARRIVES AS AN ARGUMENT. A rule that can only run against a
 * real template tree is the problem, not the fix: it drags a template copy and a
 * bundle step into any test that wants to watch it fail. So the reads are the
 * caller's job — `build.mjs` passes a reader over the copied template, a test
 * passes one over a literal — and the rules stay pure functions over data.

 * What `scripts/build.mjs` must not copy out of a starter, DERIVED from the

 *
 * THE LIST WAS THE BUG. It was a flat set of basenames, and it could not express
 * either half of what it was for. `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — generated by the
 * TanStack Router plugin on first run — was not in it, so whether that file
 * landed in `dist/templates` depended on whether a build had run first:
 * `verify:starters` builds the starters before packaging, so CI and a clean
 * checkout produced DIFFERENT template contents. Four more of the same class
 * were missing outright (`.output/`, `.nitro/`, `.tanstack/`, `.vinxi/`), and
 * those are build trees, not one file.
 *
 * A starter already declares exactly this, in the one file whose job it is.
 * `.gitignore` is required to exist (`gitignoreProblem`), it is maintained by
 * whoever adds the tool that generates the artifact, and it moves when the
 * starter's toolchain does — so the next generated artifact is skipped without
 * anybody remembering this function exists. Every tracked file in all eight
 * starters survives its own ignore rules today, checked with
 * `git ls-files | git check-ignore --stdin`, so nothing a template needs is
 * reachable from here.
 *
 * "Do not commit this" and "do not ship this in a template" are not the same
 * question in general; they coincide for everything a starter actually ignores,
 * which is build output, generated sources and `.env` files. The one place they
 * diverge is tracked-but-unwanted files, and that is what `TEMPLATE_SKIP_FLOOR`
 * is for.

/**
 * What the CLI bundle is allowed to REACH.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR HAS ALREADY HAPPENED, and it was invisible at
 * every seam that was being watched. One import — three symbols out of
 * `mcp/mcp/tools/scaffold.ts` — took `dist/index.js` from 203 kB to
 * 904 kB, of which 505 kB was zod this CLI never executes, and pushed `npx` cold
 * start from 30 ms to 45 ms. Nothing failed. Every test passed, the emitted
 * output was byte-identical, and the build printed the new size as a fact rather
 * than a problem. The only reason it was caught is that somebody read the
 * number.
 *
 * The cause is not zod and not a size: it is that `tools/scaffold.ts` builds its
 * MCP input schema at MODULE SCOPE, and a module-scope side effect is not
 * tree-shakeable, so asking esbuild for one symbol out of that file obliges it
 * to keep all 5,300 lines and everything they import. That is a property of the
 * MODULE, not of what you took from it — which is why this rule is about the
 * import graph and not about a byte ceiling. A ceiling would have to be raised
 * every time the templates grow, and raising it is exactly the moment nobody
 * looks.
 *
 * So two things are banned, and the second is the real one:
 *
 *   · `zod` — the 505 kB. Named directly because it is the cost, and because a
 *     future route into it that does not pass through `mcp/` would still be a
 *     bug this CLI should not pay for.
 *   · anything under `mcp/mcp/` — the CAUSE. `create-kai` is not the
 *     `kai` MCP; the reuse boundary `src/catalog.ts` describes is the catalog,
 *     and the three modules that serve it (`registry.ts`, `types.ts`,
 *     `route-emit.ts`) all sit at the root of `mcp/`. This half fires
 *     even in the case where the offending module happens to shake clean today,
 *     which is the version of this bug that comes back.
 *
 *     The blocks registry and the form renderer are the same kind of leaf and
 *     now live in their own package, `@kitn.ai/blocks`; `missingReuseInputsProblem`
 *     below asserts the bundle really reaches it rather than a local copy.
 *
 * ONE KNOWN FUTURE COLLISION, stated so it is not a surprise: `renderSurface`
 * lives in `tools/scaffold.ts`, and `generate()` will need it the day the
 * `generated` surface path is wired (it throws today rather than emit an unrun
 * surface). This rule WILL refuse that import, and refusing is the right answer
 * — the fix is to move `renderSurface` to a leaf the same way these three moved,
 * not to add an exception here. An exception is how the 700 kB comes back.
 *
 * Takes the esbuild METAFILE's input keys rather than the output text: that is
 * the real module graph, so a grep-proof rename or a comment mentioning zod
 * cannot move it in either direction.
