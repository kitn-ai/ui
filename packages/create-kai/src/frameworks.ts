/**
 * The framework axis.
 *
 * One entry per `examples/starters/*` tree. `templateDir` names the starter this
 * framework's project skeleton is copied from, so the starters stay the single
 * source of truth for how a consumer wires the kit — they are CI-built, so drift
 * is caught there rather than here.
 *
 * `status` is what the CLI offers. A `ready` framework has been scaffolded,
 * installed, built and driven in a browser; the rest are declared but not
 * offered, because the emitted project for those cells has not been run. Which
 * ones are which is the table below — and `--list --json` at runtime — rather
 * than a roster restated here that goes stale every time one flips. This
 * table is the whole of "turn one on": flip the status, drop the note, add the
 * template patches, and the prompt, the coverage gate and the `--list` output
 * all follow.
 *
 * `ready` MEANS RUN, NOT BUILT. Vue built green before it had a single patch,
 * while emitting a project whose browser tab read "@kitn.ai/ui Vue example" and
 * whose vite.config told the user to run `nx build ui`. `scripts/build.mjs` now
 * refuses that, but the standard the status is held to is
 * `scripts/smoke.mjs --framework <id> --keep` plus a real browser: a message
 * sent, and a reply streaming into `<kai-thread>`.
 *
 * NOT EVERY STARTER IS A CHAT APP, so for some rows flipping `status` is not a
 * table edit at all. A composed chat workspace has a composer, a thread fed by a
 * chat controller, and the kit's mock responder behind it; the rest are
 * compatibility demos — a Button rendered from a server component, a static
 * `messages` array, a registration probe — with no stream for the browser check
 * to observe and so nothing the `ready` standard above can be applied to.
 *
 * WHICH ROWS ARE WHICH IS THE `composedWorkspace` COLUMN, not a roster restated
 * here. This paragraph named six starters and excepted two by id; one of the two
 * has since been rewritten and the sentence was wrong in both halves at once,
 * which is the same failure the `status` note above already refuses to repeat.
 * The column moves when the starter does.
 *
 * `scripts/build.mjs` already refuses a demo row rather than emitting one: flip
 * one and the build stops at `appPathProblem` with "<paths.app> carries no
 * toOpenAIMessages(...) expression", because the emitted README quotes that
 * expression out of the app file and there is none to quote. That throw is the
 * guard working, not a bug in it.
 *
 * Turning one of these on is therefore work in `examples/starters/<dir>/` —
 * giving the starter a real thread + composer + mock stream, SSR-safely — and
 * only then a status flip here. SOLID IS THE WORKED EXAMPLE of that sequence:
 * it sat `planned` for exactly this reason, was rewritten from a 533-line
 * single-file primitives showcase into a composed workspace on the same gateway
 * as the other five, and only then flipped. The `goLiveThread` throw its old
 * note described was never a bug to route around; it went away when the starter
 * gained the call it was asking for.
 *
 * THE QUEUE IS EMPTY as of the Next.js flip: every row below is `ready` and every
 * starter is a composed workspace. That is a statement about today, not a rule —
 * `planned`, `note` and `composedWorkspace: false` are still live machinery for
 * the NEXT framework someone adds, and the tests that grade them now drive
 * synthetic rows rather than pointing at whichever real row was still off (see
 * `catalog.test.ts`, which had run out of subjects to point at). Nothing here
 * assumes the set stays full.
 *
 * WATCH THE `templateDir` COLUMN. It is not the id. `html` is served by
 * `examples/starters/vanilla`, and since patches are keyed by templateDir, a
 * lookup written against the id finds none and the emitted project ships the
 * kit's own example title. The build's repo-internals check is what stands
 * behind that, and generate.test.ts asserts the html patches by their effect.

    //     runs on a READY framework, so a `planned` row is never graded against
    //     its template and the defect waits for the flip. The composed starter
    //     now HAS `app/globals.css`, so the path became true rather than being
    //     edited to match a wrong file.
    //
    //   · `app/layout.tsx` imported `@kitn.ai/ui/theme.css` while
    //     `postcss.config.mjs` declared `plugins: {}` — the THIRD instance of the
    //     Tailwind-source import (#216 hit it in TanStack, #217 proved Solid is
    //     safe). Measured on the emitted asset before the fix: one raw `@theme {`
    //     at-rule in `.next/static/css/*.css`, with `--color-background` defined
    //     ONLY inside it. A browser discards an unknown at-rule whole, and
    //     `next build` was green throughout. It now imports the pre-compiled
    //     `theme.tokens.css` and the same count is zero.
    //
    //     ITS BLAST RADIUS IS NARROWER THAN "the app renders on fallbacks",
    //     which is what the audit note said and what a reader would repeat.
    //     Measured in Chromium against a scaffolded project, defect twin beside
    //     fixed: DARK mode is unaffected, because those tokens are a plain
    //     `.dark` rule rather than `@theme`. In LIGHT mode `:root` carries no
    //     `--color-*` at all, but chrome INSIDE a `kai-*` element still resolves
    //     — the elements re-scope their own tokens onto slotted content, so the
    //     sidebar still computed `rgb(244, 244, 245)`. What actually broke is the
    //     chrome OUTSIDE every element: `.app` computed
    //     `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` against `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
    //     fixed. That is precisely what `theme.tokens.css` is documented to be
    //     for, and the narrowness is why it survived review — the page looks
    //     nearly right.
    //
    //     THE RULE IS "DOES TAILWIND PROCESS THIS FILE", NOT "NEVER IMPORT
    //     theme.css" — the second is the obvious lesson and it is wrong. Solid
    //     imports the very same file and is correct, because its `styles.css`
    //     says `@import "tailwindcss"` above it and `@tailwindcss/vite` is in the
    //     pipeline, so `@theme` is COMPILED rather than discarded. A starter with
    //     Tailwind imports `theme.css`; one without imports the pre-compiled
