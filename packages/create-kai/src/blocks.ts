/**
 * `create-kai add <block>` - resolution, detection and write planning.
 *
 * THE REGISTRY IS THE KIT'S, NOT A COPY. Block logic (manifest validation,
 * discovery, the CDN-form generator) is imported from
 * `@kitn.ai/blocks` and bundled at build time,
 * exactly the way `catalog.ts` imports the scaffolder registry - one source,
 * a build failure as the drift failure mode. That module is a deliberate leaf
 * (pure, no zod, nothing under `mcp/`), so `bundleGraphProblem` stays green.
 * The block FILES ride the published CLI the way templates do:
 * `scripts/build.mjs` copies the resolved `@kitn.ai/blocks` package's
 * `blocks/` directory into `dist/blocks/`, and
 * the loader here walks whatever directory it is handed.
 *
 * THE PER-BLOCK JSON URL IS THE SAME PATH. `add https://host/r/name.json`
 * fetches the registry-item JSON (files carrying `content`) and feeds it
 * through the same validation and the same write planner the bundled registry
 * uses - the public integration surface from the spec's registry mechanics,
 * so a third-party static registry works from day one.
 *
 * WHAT RESOLUTION IS, IN FULL (spec Part 3, "what our resolution DELETES"):
 * item -> `registryDependencies` (blocks recurse; `route:<integration>` deps
 * resolve against the scaffolder catalog and emit the backend route the way
 * the scaffolder does) -> npm deps -> write files to targets -> print `docs`.
 * No components.json, no alias map, no import rewriting for the html targets;
 * the react form imports the published `@kitn.ai/ui/react` entry.
