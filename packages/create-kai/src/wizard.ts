/**
 * The construct wizard — a small guided prompt sequence that composes a
 * `Construct` (Task 1's `@kitn.ai/ui/construct`) rather than the old
 * generate()/framework/feature-list flow this package already has.
 *
 * TESTS import the real `ConstructSchema`/`CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA_URL` from
 * `@kitn.ai/ui/construct` (see `test/wizard.test.ts`) — that part of Task 2's
 * design holds. What does NOT hold, discovered wiring this module into
 * `index.ts` for the first time in Task 3, is a *runtime* import of that
 * module from here: Task 2's header used to claim "esbuild bundles it (zod
 * included) ... this package stays a zero-runtime-dependency CLI either way,"
 * but `src/build-guards.ts`'s `bundleGraphProblem` bans `node_modules/zod`
 * from the CLI bundle outright (`scripts/build.mjs` — 505 kB no `npx
 * create-kai` run executes). Nothing caught the conflict at review time
 * because nothing imported this module yet, so the bundle graph never
 * actually included it — the exact "invisible at every seam being watched"
 * shape `bundleGraphProblem`'s own docstring warns about.
 *
 * `dist/construct.js` keeps `zod` external but is one bundled file with a
 * top-level `z.discriminatedUnion(...)` side effect building `ConstructSchema`
 * — esbuild cannot tree-shake past that to pull only `CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA_URL`,
 * so importing either one drags all of it (and zod) into `dist/index.js`.
 *
 * THE FIX: the codebase's OWN established mechanism for exactly this shape —
 * a build-time-only fact baked into the bundle as a string literal, the same
 * way `__KIT_RANGE__`/`__KIT_VERSION__`/`__CLI_VERSION__` already are (see
 * `types/globals.d.ts` and `scripts/build.mjs`'s `esbuild.build({ define })`).
 * `scripts/build.mjs` imports `CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA_URL` from the WORKSPACE
 * `@kitn.ai/ui/construct` in the build script's own node process — zod loads
 * there, never in the bundle — and substitutes it as `__CONSTRUCT_SCHEMA_URL__`.
 * This file references only the global; no import of `@kitn.ai/ui/construct`
 * survives here, so `bundleGraphProblem` never sees it. A hand-copied literal
 * was the first fix attempted and was correctly rejected: this repo's "derive
 * it, don't type it" rule applies even with a drift test watching it.
 *
 * W-2's REGISTRY-DRIFT GUARANTEE (a new `ConstructSchema` key goes red until
 * classified) now lives ENTIRELY IN THE TEST LAYER, not in the bundle:
 * `test/wizard.test.ts` imports the real `ConstructSchema` and drives the
 * registry/matrix checks against it directly — this file and the shipped
 * bundle never see the schema object at all, only the one string constant the
 * build substitutes. That is a narrower guarantee than an earlier sketch of
 * this feature assumed (validating a full schema object inside the CLI
 * itself), and it is the correct one given the bundle-size constraint: the
 * tests are still driven off the real, current schema on every run, so drift
 * is still caught — just never at `npx create-kai` runtime, which was never
 * going to re-validate its own output against a schema it cannot afford to
 * ship anyway.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE MODULE FROM `axes.ts`. `shapeAxis` IS a real `Axis` and
 * follows the same "ask or state" law `decideAxis`/`answerAxis` already
 * enforce — reused here, not reimplemented — but the rest of this file
 * (`WizardAnswers`, `composeConstruct`, `WIZARD_REGISTRY`, `runWizard`) has no
 * equivalent anywhere else in the package: it is the first thing in
 * `create-kai` that emits a *construct* rather than a scaffolded project.
