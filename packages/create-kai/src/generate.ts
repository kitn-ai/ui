## The route

\`${routeFile}\` holds the provider call. The front end in
\`${framework.paths.app}\` POSTs the thread to \`/api/chat\` and streams the
reply back through \`readOpenAIStream\`, the same parser the mock path used.

Runtime: ${host?.runtime ?? 'unknown'}.

deployed build has nothing behind \`/api/chat\`. To ship, deploy the handler in

Express — and point the fetch at it.

opens with a \`: kai-mock\` comment and usage reports zero tokens, so nothing here
