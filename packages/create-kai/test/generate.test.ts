   *     sidebar and that refusal has no real (framework, feature) subject left.
   *

   * unknown feature id. That is still a live path — `--feature` takes a string
   * from the command line — and it is the same `if (!surface.ok) throw` this test
   * has always been about. The composed-only mechanism is asserted directly, with
   * a synthetic row, in catalog.test.ts.
   *
   * ORDER MATTERS AND IS ASSERTED. `generate` refuses in sequence — unknown
   * framework, unknown gateway, resolveSurface, unwired generated surface, no
   * template — so a bare `rejects.toThrow()` would pass on a LATER rule while

/**
 * Every dotfile that travelled underscored arrives under its real name.

 * WHY THIS IS A LOOP OVER A LIST AND NOT TWO NAMED TESTS. `_gitignore` had a
 * named test from the start and `.npmrc` had none, which is the whole shape of
 * the 0.1.0 defect: the mechanism was understood, tested, and applied to one
 * file. So the subject is `STRIPPED_DOTFILES` — the list `scripts/build.mjs`
 * renames from and `generate()` renames back to — and a row added there is
 * covered here without anybody remembering this block exists.
 *
 * WHICH TEMPLATES CARRY WHICH FILE IS READ OFF DISK, not declared. `.gitignore`
 * is required of every starter and `.npmrc` only exists in the two standalone
 * ones; hard-coding that split would make this test wrong the day a Vite starter
 * grows an `.npmrc`, and wrong in the silent direction.
 *
 * THE VACUITY GUARD AT THE END IS THE POINT. Every assertion in the loop is
 * conditional on the template having the travelling file, so a build that
 * emitted no `_npmrc` at all — which is precisely the regression — would run
 * this block to completion, assert nothing about it, and pass.
