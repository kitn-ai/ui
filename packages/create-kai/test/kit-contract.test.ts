/**
 * The drift guard: every `@kitn.ai/ui` import the TEMPLATES make must be
 * something the kit actually exports.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, WITH THE INCIDENT. `create-kai` pins a published range of
 * `@kitn.ai/ui` and copies templates out of `examples/starters/*`. Those two
 * move independently: the starters track the workspace kit and are CI-built
 * against `workspace:*`, while the pin points at npm. When the parts[] migration
 * landed in the tree but not on npm, the React starter imported
 * `@kitn.ai/ui/wire`, `MessagePart` and `createMockResponder` — none of which the
 * latest published version had. The emitted project installed cleanly and then
 * failed with nine type errors on `npm run build`.
 *
 * So this test reads the imports out of the templates and checks them against
 * the kit's own `exports` map and `.d.ts` files. It runs against the WORKSPACE
 * kit, which is the version the templates are written for, so a green run means
 * "templates agree with the kit they ship beside" — it does NOT by itself prove
 * the PINNED range is publishable. `verify-pin.mjs` is the check for that, and
 * it needs the network.
