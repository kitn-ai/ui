/**
 * GUARD — `verify:pack` still DETECTS.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, stated plainly because it is an indictment of the change
 * that shipped without it. `verify-pack.mjs` was wired into the required CI job
 * and given a `prepublishOnly` hook, and at that moment its own rules had no
 * test at all. A verifier then neutered the script — forcing its findings array
 * to constant-empty — and the whole suite stayed green; run against a genuinely
 * broken tree, the neutered script printed `7 of 8 with a _gitignore` and exited
 * 0. `test/publish-shape.test.ts` grades that the hook is WIRED to call it and
 * that CI INVOKES it, both by string, and neither question is whether the thing
 * being invoked still works.
 *
 * That is the same failure this whole change is downstream of: a check that
 * cannot fire reads exactly like a clean tree. So nothing here trusts the
 * script's self-report. Each rule is watched REJECTING a planted defect in a
 * throwaway package root, and the exit code is what is asserted.
 *
 * THE FIXTURES ARE SYNTHETIC ON PURPOSE. Pointing these at the real `dist/`
 * would make them pass or fail on whether someone had run a build, and the one
 * case that matters most — a single template regressing — cannot be planted in
 * the real tree without breaking it for every other test in the suite.
 *
 * COST: each case shells out to `npm pack --dry-run --json` in a temp dir, which
 * is ~1s. That is the price of grading the packed listing rather than a model of
 * it, and the packed listing is the only place these defects are visible.
