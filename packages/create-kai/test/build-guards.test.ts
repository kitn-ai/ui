/**
 * Assert the move cannot rot back.
 *
 * `scripts/build.mjs` ends in `main().catch(...)`, so importing it runs a build:
 * anything defined there is unreachable from a test by construction, and a rule
 * nobody can watch fail is a rule nobody should trust. That is not a style
 * preference, it is the property the move bought, and the next person to add a
 * guard will reach for the file that already does the reading.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PARSE AND NOT A GREP, which is a correction rather than a
 * polish. It was a regex over line-anchored declarations named
 * `verify|check|assert|guard`, and it had TWO holes — both demonstrated against
 * this tree by planting the shape and watching the suite stay green:
 *
 *   - A rule nested inside a function was invisible, because `^` cannot match an
 *     indented declaration. That hole was disclosed in the note this replaces.
 *   - A rule at the TOP LEVEL was invisible too, if it was named the way every
 *     rule in `src/build-guards.ts` is named. `patchMatchProblem`,
 *     `gitignoreProblem`, `sharedDevDepsProblem`: none of the four prefixes that
 *     regex looked for is the convention this repo actually uses, so the one
 *     name a next author would copy off the neighbours was the one name that
 *     slipped through. That hole was INSIDE the check's stated reach and was not
 *     disclosed — which makes it the worse of the two.
 *
 * AND THE BLIND SPOT WAS NOT EMPTY. The first thing the parse found was two
 * rules still living in `build.mjs`: `no framework is marked ready`, inlined in
 * `main()`, and `no starter at ...`, inlined in `copyTemplate` beside the `cp`
 * it explains — the same function #205 pulled the `.gitignore` rule out of. Both
 * are now in `src/build-guards.ts` with the tests above.
 *
 * So the check asks two questions of the parsed file, because a rule can hide
 * from either one alone:
 *
 *   1. Is there a guard-shaped FUNCTION at any depth? `copyTemplate`, `walk` and
 *      `readTemplateFiles` are filesystem plumbing and belong there. What must
 *      not reappear is a rule.
 *   2. Does the file write a MESSAGE of its own? A rule's payload is its message,
 *      and `build.mjs` throws what a rule returned — so an authored message is a
 *      rule, whatever it is called and even if it is called nothing. That is the
 *      only one of the two that could have seen the anonymous `.gitignore`
 *      requirement #205 had to extract.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated at the size it is now rather than papered over: a rule
 * that declares no guard-shaped name AND writes no message of its own is still
 * invisible — one that reuses another rule's text, or one that silently drops
 * something instead of failing. `SKIP` is that shape deliberately: it is a copy
 * filter, not a check, and nothing it does can fail a build.
