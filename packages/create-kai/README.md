# create-kai

Scaffold a runnable [`@kitn.ai/ui`](https://ui.kitn.ai) chat app.

```bash
npm create kai@latest
npx create-kai my-app
```

Press Enter through every prompt and you get React + full-screen + conversation
history + the kit's local mock: a project that streams a reply on the first
`npm run dev`, with no API key and no backend.

## Status

**First slice of v1.** A `ready` framework has been scaffolded, installed from
the registry, built by its own build script, and driven in a browser — a message
sent, and a reply streaming into `<kai-thread>`. Remaining frameworks, layouts,
features and gateways are declared in the tables but not offered.

**The prompt offers only what scaffolds, and states the rest.** One surface runs
today — the hand-composed workspace, with conversation history — so the CLI says
so rather than showing a menu of six and refusing five of them after the last
question. Where an axis has one possible answer it is stated, not asked, and
`--features <id>` for anything unavailable fails immediately with what IS
available, before a file is written. `test/menu-honesty.test.ts` drives every
option the prompt offers through `generate()`, so a menu item that cannot be
scaffolded fails a test rather than a user.

**`create-kai --list` is the roster.** This paragraph used to name which
frameworks were ready, and it was wrong within a day of each one landing — so
the list lives in `src/frameworks.ts` and at runtime in `--list --json`, and
nowhere else.

Vue went first among the `registration: 'web-components'` + `composedWorkspace: true`
cells and paid for the shared machinery: a framework could go `ready` with **no
patches at all** and the build would still print "2 patches verified", shipping
the kit's own example title and `nx build ui` into a user's project. That hole
is closed by the repo-internals check below, which reads the emitted output
instead of the patch list — and it is what caught Svelte and HTML on their first
`ready` build, naming every offending line, exactly as intended.

Each of the later cells then needed only its own patches. The one decision
neither React nor Vue had to make: the vanilla template's vite config describes
ITSELF ("unlike the React/Vue examples", "this is the showcase"), which is true
of a starter in `examples/` and false of the project a user just scaffolded.
Nothing in the repo-internals list catches that — it is not an unfollowable
instruction, just a sentence about the wrong project — so that patch rewrites
the paragraph rather than stopping short of it.

## Gateways

`mock` needs nothing. A real gateway needs a **server route**, because its key
must not reach the browser — `keyExposure: 'needs-proxy'` on the integration is
what says so. So a gateway is wirable per **(gateway, framework) cell**, never
per gateway: the integration has to have a route, and the framework has to
declare somewhere to put it (`FrameworkDef.route`).

`create-kai --list --json` reports both axes, including which frameworks each
wired gateway can be scaffolded onto. Read that, not the paragraphs below —
they explain the *shape* of the remaining work, and the counts move.

**Wired today: `openrouter` and `anthropic`,** on the frameworks whose route
host is declared.

`openrouter` was the first because it needs the least: `deps.npm` is empty (the
route is global `fetch`, no SDK), it returns `openai-sse` and forwards
`upstream.body` unchanged, and its handler calls none of the kit's content
helpers.

`anthropic` was listed here as *cheap but blocked* until the kit exported
`chatRoutePreamble` — its route calls `wireParts` / `wireText` to re-map
attachments, and those declarations were private. It now costs one line, and
two facts made that true which neither `streamFormat` nor any other field would
tell you:

- Its route **re-frames to OpenAI SSE** (`reframeToOpenAISse`) before returning,
  so the emitted front end reads it with `readOpenAIStream` unchanged — despite
  `streamFormat: 'native'`.
- It takes OpenAI-shaped messages *in* and maps them server-side, so the front
  end still sends `toOpenAIMessages(...)`. The go-live patch is untouched.

### What the browser receives is not `streamFormat`

`streamFormat` describes what the **provider** emits. `BROWSER_WIRE` in
`src/catalog.ts` describes what comes back **out of the route**, and the two
differ for `anthropic`. This matters because the mismatch is silent: the kit's
own catalog note says feeding a foreign dialect to `readOpenAIStream` "does not
throw — it parses to nothing and the turn ends silently empty". `routeWireProblem`
requires an entry per wired gateway rather than defaulting one.

### What the rest cost

Three separate walls, and most of the remaining integrations are behind more
than one. The groups are the kit registry's own — `listGatewayGroups()` — not a
split invented here.

**Cheap.** `openai` is now the cheapest unwired one: `outOfBand: 'none'`,
TypeScript, empty `deps.npm`, an OpenAI-format route. `mastra` is unblocked by
the preamble export too, but is out-of-band (below).

**Unblocked on the preamble, still blocked on the reader.** `vercel-ai-sdk`'s
route returns an AI-SDK stream, which `readOpenAIStream` cannot read. Wiring it
needs a **reader axis in the go-live patch** — the patch hard-codes
`readOpenAIStream` today. `BROWSER_WIRE` refuses it rather than letting that be
discovered as an empty bubble.

`vercel-ai-sdk` and `langgraph` also carry real `deps.npm`, which the
`package.json` rewrite already handles but which neither wired gateway
exercises — both declare none. That claim is graded by a unit test against
`langgraph` instead of by the smoke run.

**Needs something running that a scaffold cannot provide.** `ollama` (a local
server), `pi` (a local binary), `mastra` (a local server), `pydantic-ai` (a
Python runtime). These are `outOfBand !== 'none'`, and the field exists to say
exactly this. A scaffold can emit the route and the env file; it cannot make the
thing answer. `ollama` is also the one integration that is `frontend-safe` *and*
out-of-band — it needs no proxy at all, so wiring it is a different job from the
others rather than a smaller one.

**Cannot share the TypeScript route path at all.** `pydantic-ai` is
`language: 'python'`, and `pi` has no `webRoute` — only an `express`
`routeTemplate`. Neither goes through `emitRoute`, which assembles the portable
handler; both need their own emit path and their own host.

### The framework half

The route destination is what the eight frameworks disagree about most, and it
is the axis that actually gates widening:

- **Meta-frameworks are cheap** — one file, no config edit, and the route ships
  in production. `nextjs` is done (`app/api/chat/route.ts`); `svelte`
  (`src/routes/api/chat/+server.ts`, and `POST(event)` not `POST(request)`) and
  `tanstack-start` (`createFileRoute(...)({ server: { handlers } })`) are the
  same shape with different declarations.
- **Vite SPAs cost three files and a config edit**, and the result is
  **development only** — `vite build` emits no server. `react` is done; `vue`,
  `solid` and `html` are the same work. `vue`'s config edit is the risky one:
  its plugin list carries `isCustomElement`, and clobbering it makes every
  `kai-*` tag stop resolving.
- **`angular` is its own shape** — the route belongs in the `src/server.ts` that
  `ng add @angular/ssr` generates, registered *before* the catch-all, and a
  non-SSR Angular app cannot host `/api/chat` at all.
- **`html` has no server anywhere.** The handler has to run elsewhere and be
  proxied.

### What is read from the kit, and what it costs

`chatRoutePreamble(fragment)`, `CLIENT_MODEL_IDS` and `defaultModelFor` come
from `mcp/route-emit.ts` — a **leaf module** whose only import is
type-only. This package used to carry copies of the first two plus guards to
watch them drift; both copies and one guard are gone.

The preamble is a **function**, not a constant, and that shape is load-bearing:
the content helpers are injected only where a route calls them, because an
unused declaration is a hard `--noUnusedLocals` error. Emitted proof — the
`anthropic` route declares `wireParts` / `wireText` / `WirePart`, the
`openrouter` route declares none of them, and both compile.

**WHICH MODULE THEY COME FROM IS THE WHOLE COST.** They were briefly exported
from `mcp/mcp/tools/scaffold.ts` instead, and that one import line cost
two things nobody priced in advance:

1. **Bundle.** `dist/index.js` went 203 kB → 904 kB, **505 kB of it zod the CLI
   never executes** — because `scaffold.ts` builds the MCP tool's input schema at
   module scope, and a module-scope side effect is not tree-shakeable, so esbuild
   had to keep all 5,300 lines and everything they import. Cold start 30 ms →
   45 ms, on every `npx create-kai`.
2. **tsconfig coupling.** 5,300 lines of kit source joined this package's `tsc`
   program, which runs `noUnusedLocals` while the kit's own typecheck does not —
   so a flag this package chose became a constraint on a file it does not own,
   and it forced a deletion in the kit to keep this build green.

Moving them to `route-emit.ts` undid both: **917.2 kB → 220.3 kB** measured on the
same commit (zod entirely out of the graph, not merely smaller), and
`scaffold.ts` out of this package's `tsc` program.

Two pairs of numbers appear above and they are not in conflict: **203 → 904 kB**
is what the regression cost when it landed, and **917.2 → 220.3 kB** is this
package built with and without the fix on today's base. Both ends drifted up by
~13 kB in between because `integrations/vercel-ai-sdk.ts` grew, and that file is
in the CLI's graph legitimately — it is a catalog entry. Re-measure both ends
together rather than quoting either half against a different commit.

**The coupling is reduced, not gone.** 15 kit source files are still in this
package's `tsc` program under `noUnusedLocals` — the registry, `types.ts`, the
11 integrations and `route-emit.ts`. That is the catalog this package exists to
read, so it is the coupling that was always intended; what left is the MCP tool
that was never meant to be here.

`bundleGraphProblem` in `src/build-guards.ts` is what stops this coming back. It
grades the esbuild **metafile's module graph** — not the output text and not a
byte ceiling, because a ceiling has to be raised as the templates grow and
raising it is the moment nobody looks. It bans `zod` (the cost) and everything
under `mcp/mcp/` (the cause). Watched failing three ways: the rule
against a written-out graph, the rule against the real bundle, and `npm run
build` exiting 1 with the same message when the original import is put back.

### What is deliberately not shared

The per-framework **route wrappers**. The kit MCP's `WEB_ROUTE_ADAPTERS` emit one
paste-able string concatenating three files with `// ── separators ──` and a
commented-out config line. This CLI writes real files that have to compile, so
the wrapper lives beside the framework table that owns every other per-framework
path.

## How it is put together

Two sources of truth, neither of them copied:

- **Templates** are `examples/starters/*`, copied into `dist/templates/` by
  `scripts/build.mjs`. The starters are CI-built, so drift is caught there.
  Everything except the `package.json` rewrite and the patches in
  `src/patches.ts` is a byte-for-byte copy.
- **Gateways and renderable surfaces** come from
  `packages/ui/mcp/`, imported by relative path and bundled at
  build time (`src/catalog.ts`). Env var names, `deps`, `keyExposure`, route
  templates and `renderSurface` are read, never restated. A second copy of any
  of those has a build failure as its failure mode.

The CLI is bundled to one zero-dependency file so `npx` cold start is fast. It
is **not** the `kai` MCP (`npx @kitn.ai/kai mcp`), and it is not a runtime
dependency of anything it scaffolds.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build          # copy templates, verify patches, bundle dist/index.js
npm test               # unit + golden + the kit-contract drift guard
npm run typecheck
npm run verify:pack    # assert the PUBLISHED tarball is shippable
npm run smoke          # scaffold -> install -> build, against the workspace kit
```

`npm run build` must run before `npm test` (the tests read `dist/templates`),
and `nx build ui` must have run before the kit-contract test (it reads the kit's
built `.d.ts`).

## The guards, and what each one is for

Every one of these has been watched failing; a guard nobody has seen go red is
not evidence.

| Guard | Catches |
|---|---|
| `scripts/build.mjs` patch check | a template patch that silently stopped matching, which would ship `workspace:*` instructions into a user's project |
| `scripts/build.mjs` repo-internals check | the patch you did **not** write. The patch check above proves the declared patches match; it passes vacuously on a framework with an empty patch list, which is how Vue's first `ready` build emitted "@kitn.ai/ui Vue example" as the browser-tab title and told the user to run `nx build ui`. This one patches in memory and greps the RESULT |
| `scripts/build.mjs` app-path check | `paths.app` naming a file the template does not have. It is written into `kai.json` and quoted in the emitted README, and nothing else opens it at build time — so React's `src/App.tsx` copied onto a Vue row would go unnoticed |
| `scripts/build.mjs` devDep check | a devDependency range disagreeing with `packages/ui`. `.npmrc` sets `node-linker=hoisted`, so one version wins workspace-wide — an `@types/node: ^22` here downgraded the KIT from 26 and broke its emitted-code suite |
| `test/kit-contract.test.ts` | a template importing something the kit does not export |
| `scripts/build.mjs` bundle-graph check | the CLI bundle reaching a module it must not. Three symbols imported out of the MCP's `tools/scaffold.ts` took `dist/index.js` from 203 kB to 904 kB, 505 kB of it zod, and **every other check stayed green** — emitted output was byte-identical, `verify:scaffold` was 616/616. It grades the esbuild metafile's real module graph, so it bans the CAUSE (anything under `mcp/mcp/`) and not only the symptom |
| `scripts/verify-pack.mjs` | what only the PACKED tarball can show. npm drops a fixed set of names from every package whatever `files` says, so a template carrying one loses it at publish time and nowhere else: the working tree has it, the build copies it, every test that reads `dist/templates` sees it. `.gitignore` was handled from the start; `.npmrc` was not, and 0.1.0 shipped `nextjs` and `tanstack-start` with none while the bundled CLI still patched one — `ENOENT: ... open '.../myapp/.npmrc'` on the first command a user runs, two of eight frameworks, with this script printing `tarball OK`. It now checks the whole `STRIPPED_DOTFILES` list rather than one name, and asserts every file the patch tables OPEN is in the listing — derived from `PATCHES`/`GATEWAY_PATCHES`, because a hand-written list would have had exactly the hole that produced this. Also: templates missing from `files`, and a template that packs to nothing |
| `scripts/smoke.mjs` | an emitted project that installs but does not build. `--framework all` covers every ready framework; without a flag it only ever built React, which meant it answered "does React still build" no matter which framework you had just turned on |

## Publish gate

`create-kai` pins `^<kit version>`, derived at build time from
`packages/ui/package.json`. It must not publish until the kit version it pins is
on npm and carries everything the templates import.

Check before publishing, against the tarball the pin resolves to:

```bash
npm pack @kitn.ai/ui@<pinned> && tar -xzf kitn.ai-ui-<pinned>.tgz
KAI_KIT_ROOT=./package npx vitest run test/kit-contract.test.ts
```

Green means an emitted project will build for a user.

**The blocker this section used to describe is cleared.** It read: the latest
published kit is 0.20.1, which predates `@kitn.ai/ui/wire`, `MessagePart` and
`createMockResponder`, so an emitted project installs cleanly and then fails
`npm run build` with nine type errors. **0.21.0 is published and carries all
three.** The gate above is green against it for every ready template, and
every ready framework's emitted project, pinned to `^0.21.0`, installs from the
registry, passes its own build script, and streams in a browser.

Re-run it against whatever the pin resolves to; do not read this paragraph as
standing permission.

## Adding a framework

`src/frameworks.ts` is the table. Flip `status` to `ready` and drop its `note`,
add its patches to `src/patches.ts`, and the build copies its template, the
prompt offers it, and `--list` reports it.

The build tells you which patches you owe: flip the status first and run it, and
the repo-internals check names every repo-internal line the template would ship,
file by file. That is the intended order — you are not expected to find them by
reading.

Then find out whether it actually runs:

```bash
node scripts/smoke.mjs --framework <id>   # scaffold -> install -> build
node scripts/smoke.mjs --framework <id> --keep   # ... and leave it to `npm run dev`
```

**`--keep` and a browser are the step that counts.** A framework is not `ready`
because it built; it is `ready` because a message sent in a real browser streamed
a reply into `<kai-thread>`. Vue's build was green before its patches existed and
while its README pointed at `src/App.tsx`.

When you drive it, assert on the RIGHT PAGE and on GROWTH:

- Every Vite starter's dev script has a fixed `server.port`, and Vite does
  **not** use `strictPort` — a port already in use makes it quietly serve on the
  next one instead. Drive it with `--port <n> --strictPort`, and kill by
  process GROUP (`spawn(..., { detached: true })` + `process.kill(-pid)`);
  killing the `npm` wrapper alone orphans the `vite` child, which then squats
  the port for the next framework you test. Both traps fired here: the html run
  hit a leaked svelte server on 5176 and "passed", and because all these
  starters render the same design the screenshots were pixel-identical, which
  read as success. Assert `document.title` — every scaffold patches it to the
  project name — so the run is bound to the app you meant to test.
- Sample `<kai-thread>` on an interval and require the text to GROW across
  several distinct samples. One non-empty read is satisfied by the seeded
  conversation that is already on screen before you type anything.
- The composer is `contenteditable="plaintext-only"` inside a shadow root, not a
  `textarea`. A bare `textarea` selector finds the sidebar's search box instead.
