/**
 * The end-to-end smoke test: scaffold, install, BUILD.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD AND NOT A FILE-EXISTENCE CHECK. A CLI test that asserts files were
 * written proves nothing about whether the project runs — this repo has shipped
 * a scaffold that looked right and did nothing. `npm run build` runs `tsc -b`
 * over the emitted sources against the real installed kit, which is what caught
 * that the published kit predates the parts[] migration: nine type errors on a
 * project that had installed perfectly.
 *
 * It packs the WORKSPACE kit and installs that tarball through the CLI's own
 * `--kit` flag, so the emitted project goes through the same rewrite a user's
 * does rather than around it.
 *
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs                      # pack the workspace kit, scaffold, install, build
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --kit <spec>         # check some other kit (e.g. a published range)
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --keep               # leave the project on disk to `npm run dev`
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --framework vue      # one framework
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --framework all      # every ready framework, in order
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --gateway openrouter --framework all   # the wired cells
 *
 * THE CONSTRUCT LEG (Task 3) IS DELIBERATELY CHEAP AND SEPARATE FROM THE
 * FRAMEWORK LEGS ABOVE. `--shape widget`/`--shape fullscreen` never call
 * `generate()` — there is no project to install or build, only a JSON file to
 * write — so proving it end-to-end needs neither `npm install` nor a pty, just
 * the built CLI plus the real `ConstructSchema` to validate against. It reads
 * the schema from the WORKSPACE kit's own `dist/construct.js` rather than the
 * packed tarball this script pins for the framework legs: the construct format
 * is Task 1's, published on `@kitn.ai/ui`'s ordinary `./construct` export, not
 * something `--kit` repoints — so the workspace build is the honest copy to
 * check against, the same one `wizard.ts`'s tests already validate against.
 *
 * WHY `--gateway` EXISTS, and what it does NOT prove. The gateway path emits a
 * server route, and a route is the only code create-kai GENERATES rather than
 * copies — so it is the only code with no CI-built starter behind it. Compiling
 * it is therefore worth more here than anywhere else: `npm run build` puts the
 * emitted handler through the emitted project's own tsconfig, which for a Vite
 * app is a NODE project with no DOM lib, where `request.json()` is
 * `Promise<unknown>` and a route that destructures it does not compile.
 *
 * It proves the route COMPILES and the app BUILDS. It does not call a provider,
 * and nothing here should ever be made to: `.env.local` is emitted with a
 * placeholder, and a real key would turn a smoke run into spend. What happens on
 * a real first message is not covered by this script.
 *
 * `--gateway all` is deliberately absent. A gateway is wirable per (gateway,
 * framework) CELL, not per gateway, so "all" would have to mean the product —
 * and the CLI refuses the cells it cannot wire, which would read as a smoke
 * failure. Pass the pair you mean.
 *
 * WHY `--framework` EXISTS. This script is documented as how you find out
 * whether a newly-`ready` framework runs, and it took `--yes` with no framework
 * flag — which is the zero-config path, which is React. So it answered "does
 * React still build" no matter which framework you had just turned on. Vue was
 * turned on and smoked green here without a single Vue file being compiled.
 *
 * AND `npm run build` IS NOT ALWAYS A TYPECHECK. Six starters chain or embed a
 * checker in their build; TanStack Start's is a bare `vite build`, which strips
 * types with esbuild rather than checking them. Running only `build` there would
 * print a green tick over a project that does not compile — the same shape of
 * vacuous pass as the two above. `src/starter-scripts.ts` decides which scripts
 * to run from the emitted project's own package.json.
