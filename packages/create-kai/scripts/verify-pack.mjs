/**
 * Verify the PUBLISHED tarball, not the working tree.
 *
 * Three of the ways this CLI can ship broken are invisible locally and only
 * appear once npm has packed it:
 *
 *   1. npm strips any file named `.gitignore` out of a tarball. A template that
 *      carried one would lose it, and every emitted project would ignore
 *      nothing — committing `node_modules/`, and eventually `.env.local`. The
 *      templates therefore carry `_gitignore`, and this asserts EVERY template
 *      really has it under that name.
 *   2. `files: ["dist"]` has to actually carry the templates. A scaffold with a
 *      bundled CLI and no templates fails on the user's first run, having
 *      installed and printed nothing wrong.
 *   3. Every file the bundled CLI OPENS at scaffold time has to be in there. See
 *      the rule below; this one was added after a published release proved the
 *      first two do not imply it.
 *
 * TWO CORRECTIONS, both measured against this tree rather than reasoned about,
 * because the version of this file that shipped the gate into CI was nearly
 * non-discriminating on rule 1 and neither half was visible from its output.
 *
 * THE COUNT WAS GLOBAL, SO IT ONLY FIRED ON TOTAL LOSS. `underscored.length ===
 * 0` is satisfied by any single template still having the file, so reverting
 * react's `_gitignore` to `.gitignore` printed `tarball OK — 175 files, 8
 * template(s), 7 _gitignore` and exited 0. Seven of eight is the shape a real
 * regression has — one starter edited, one copy rule changed — and total loss is
 * the shape it almost never has. The check now runs PER TEMPLATE and names the
 * offenders, because a reviewer who is told a count still has to go find out
 * which.
 *
 * AND THE LITERAL-`.gitignore` SCAN COULD NOT FIRE AT ALL. It read the packed
 * listing for a file named `.gitignore` — but npm strips the file BEFORE it
 * appears there, which is the very premise of rule 1. Measured on npm 10.9.8:
 * planting `dist/templates/react/.gitignore` takes the listing from 176 files to
 * 175 and adds nothing; nothing is renamed to `.npmignore` either, so there is
 * no packed artefact of any name to look for. That scan was unfalsifiable while
 * reading as coverage, so it is gone. What replaced it asks the same question
 * one layer earlier, where the answer is still observable: it walks `dist/` ON
 * DISK, which is where the file demonstrably is. That version is also strictly
 * stronger — it holds whatever a future npm decides to do with the file.
 *
 * Run after `npm run build`.
 *
 * READING THE PACKED LISTING IS ITS OWN PROBLEM, and it broke a release: npm 12
 * moved the top level of `npm pack --json` from an array to an object keyed by
 * package name, so the one-liner that used to live here threw a TypeError at
 * publish time. That parse now lives in <repo>/scripts/pack-listing.mjs — at the
 * root because packages/ui's guards hit the same defect and share it — and it
 * carries the measurement and is graded against captured fixtures of both shapes.

 * EVERY FILE THE BUNDLED CLI OPENS AT SCAFFOLD TIME IS IN THE TARBALL.

 * _gitignore` over the package that carried it. `create-kai@0.1.0` shipped
 * `nextjs` and `tanstack-start` templates with no `.npmrc` — npm strips that
 * name too — while the bundled `dist/index.js` still had a `PATCHES` row that
 * opens one. Two of the eight advertised frameworks died on the first command a
 * user runs:
 *
 *     Scaffolding failed
 *     ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../myapp/.npmrc'
 *
 * NOTHING IN THE UNIT SUITE COULD HAVE SEEN IT, which is why the rule belongs
 * here and not there. `test/generate.test.ts` asserts the emitted `.npmrc`
 * carries no monorepo path — it reads `dist/templates` on disk, where the file
 * demonstrably is. The tarball is the only layer where the file is absent.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE PATCH TABLES, never a list. A hand-written list of files to
 * check would have exactly the hole that produced this: it would say
 * `_gitignore` and `package.json`, because those are the files someone thought
 * of. `PATCHES` and `GATEWAY_PATCHES` are what `generate()` actually opens, so a
 * new patch row arms this rule for its file on the same commit that adds it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated rather than implied: `paths.app`, which
 * `generate()` also reads, and the route destinations it writes. Those are in
 * `src/frameworks.ts` and carry ordinary names npm has no opinion about; the
 * literal-dotfile rule above is what stands between them and this failure mode.

 * moving, so a stale or cache-restored bundle carries a pin that was correct
 * when it was made and is not any more.
