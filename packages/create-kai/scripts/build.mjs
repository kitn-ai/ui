/**
 * Build `create-kai` into a single bundled file plus its templates.
 *
 * Three jobs, in order:
 *   1. Copy `examples/starters/<dir>` for every READY framework into
 *      `dist/templates/`. The starters are the single source of truth for how a
 *      consumer wires the kit, and they are CI-built, so drift is caught there.
 *   2. Verify every template patch still matches the file it patches, and fail
 *      loudly if one does not. A patch that silently stops matching ships a
 *      `workspace:*` instruction into a user's project. Then check the PATCHED
 *      result against `src/template-guards.ts` — the patches you did not write
 *      are the ones that ship the defect, so the output is what gets graded.
 *   3. Bundle `src/index.ts` to one zero-dependency ESM file, so `npx` cold
 *      start is fast. `@clack/prompts` and `picocolors` are bundled in; so is
 *      the kit's `mcp` catalog, which is why the CLI can hand out real
 *      `Integration` objects without depending on `@kitn.ai/ui` at runtime.
 *
 * THE RULES THEMSELVES ARE NOT IN THIS FILE, and that is deliberate. This module
 * ends in `main().catch(...)`, so importing it runs a build — nothing here can
 * be reached from a test, and a check nobody can watch fail is a check nobody
 * should trust. Every rule lives in `src/build-guards.ts` (structural) or
 * `src/template-guards.ts` (content), where `test/build-guards.test.ts` and
 * `test/template-guards.test.ts` drive each one directly. What is left here is
 * the filesystem: copy the tree, read the bytes, hand them to a rule, throw what
 * it returns.
 *
 * SO THIS FILE STATES NO RULE TEXT OF ITS OWN. Every message a failing build
 * prints was written by a rule and arrived here as a return value; `failIf` is
 * the only thing that throws. `test/build-guards.test.ts` parses this file and
 * holds it to that — a guard-shaped function at any depth, or a message literal
 * authored here, fails the suite and points at `src/build-guards.ts`.
