// Copy the GENERATED block artifacts into the site's public/ tree, and decide
// -- once -- which kit the previews run against.
//
// The site never regenerates a block. `packages/ui/scripts/gen-blocks.mjs`
// writes dist/blocks/ during the kit build; this copies it. Same bounded-copy
// discipline as copy-kit-assets.mjs beside it, and the outputs are gitignored
// for the same reason.
//
// THE PREVIEW SWITCH. Production (KAI_BLOCKS_KIT unset) previews the PUBLISHED
// kit off jsDelivr at the pin lint:cdn-pins keeps equal to package.json, which
// is what makes the page standing proof that the published block runs cold.
// KAI_BLOCKS_KIT=local previews the build in your working tree, which is most
// of a block's life. The two look identical on screen, so the footer says
// which in words and scripts/verify-preview-source.mjs asserts the production
// build carries the CDN URL and no local path.
//
// Astro exposes only PUBLIC_* env to client code, and this switch must never
// be reachable by accident from a deploy environment, so the decision is
// written into src/generated/blocks-preview.ts and imported by the island.
