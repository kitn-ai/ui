// THE PRODUCTION BUILD PREVIEWS THE PUBLISHED KIT. Spec 5.6.
//
// The two preview modes look identical on screen and only one of them proves
// anything: the production page is the standing evidence that a pasted block
// runs cold off the CDN. The failure this catches is KAI_BLOCKS_KIT=local
// leaking into a deploy, which looks perfect, serves a kit path that is not
// deployed, and quietly retires the proof while the footer still claims it.
//
//   node scripts/verify-preview-source.mjs
//   node scripts/verify-preview-source.mjs --require-published  # deploy form
//   node scripts/verify-preview-source.mjs --self-test          # prove it detects
//
// Runs over apps/docs/dist AFTER a production build. It never skips: a missing
// dist is a hard failure, because "no build to check" is how a guard that
// proves nothing looks from the outside.
//
// TWO MODES, AND WHY. The structural checks below are facts about THIS
// checkout and are always fatal. The PUBLISHED-ENTRY probe is a fact about
// npm and jsDelivr at this moment: it HEADs every kit entry the built
// previews import and reports whether the registry actually serves it. That
// can be red for a reason no commit here can fix -- the kit version the forms
// pin ships a new entry only at the next release -- so it must not hold the
// required CI graph hostage to the release cadence. Hence: `dist-guards` runs
// the plain form and gets a WARNING table with the exit code untouched, and
// the deploy workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml, wired in Task 9)
// runs --require-published, where a non-200 is fatal because shipping that
// deploy would put empty previews on the live page. There the probe asks a
// second time before calling a non-404 a miss, and the epilogue names which
// of the two causes it found: a 404 waits on a release, anything else means
// the registry did not answer and the run is worth repeating.
//
// The footer wording is IMPORTED from copy-blocks.mjs rather than restated
// here: that script is where the preview source is decided, so a guard with
// its own copy of the sentence could go green over a footer nobody writes.
