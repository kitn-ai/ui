# Svelte example — chat workspace, composed by hand

A small chat **workspace assembled from `@kitn.ai/ui`'s individual web components** — a
`<kai-conversations>` sidebar, a `<kai-thread>` of messages, and a
`<kai-prompt-input>` composer — wired together with plain Svelte 5 runes. Non-React
frameworks consume the **raw `kai-*` web components directly** (no wrappers), so
this is the reference for how that composition looks in Svelte. It mirrors
`examples/react` and `examples/vue` feature-for-feature.

It runs with **no backend**: replies stream in from the kit's own mock responder,
`createMockResponder()` from `@kitn.ai/ui/state` (wired up in `src/chat-data.ts`),
so there's no API key and nothing to host. The mock yields SSE frames that
`readOpenAIStream` parses exactly as it parses a real provider's, so the preview
runs the real streaming path — and swapping `mockResponse(text)` for a real
`fetch` (Anthropic, OpenAI, your own endpoint) is the only change you make.

Nothing here can be mistaken for a real turn: the stream opens with a `: kai-mock`
SSE comment, every frame carries a `_kai_mock` field, `model` reports as
`kai-mock`, and usage is all zeros.

## The Svelte web-component rules

Consuming Shadow-DOM custom elements from Svelte comes down to four things:

- **No custom-element config needed.** Svelte already treats any hyphenated tag
  (`kai-*`) as a native custom element and passes props/events through to the DOM —
  there's no Svelte equivalent of Vue's `isCustomElement`.
- **Register before mount.** `src/main.ts` does `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'`
  (registers the web components) and `import '@kitn.ai/ui/theme.tokens.css'` (the plain
  `--color-*` tokens the shell uses), then waits on `customElements.whenDefined(...)`
  for every tag **before** `mount(App, { target })`. The web components register
  asynchronously; without that gate the initial property writes hit not-yet-upgraded
  elements and are lost.
- **Array/object props + boolean flags are DOM properties, not attributes.** Rich
  values (`messages`, `conversations`, `groups`, `triggers`, `suggestions`) and
  boolean flags (`voice`, `loading`, `collapsed`) are set imperatively with
  `bind:this` + `$effect` (`el.messages = value`), which guarantees they land on the
  upgraded element as properties. A bare `voice` attribute reads as off; the facade
  wants `el.voice === true`. Scalars (`theme`, `placeholder`, `size`, `active-id`)
  are plain attributes.
- **Updating a list needs a new array AND a new object for each item you changed.**
  The new array reference is what tells the element something changed — assigning the
  same array back is a no-op even if you swapped an item inside it. The new item object
  is what makes the change visible, because the lists key their rows by item identity.
  Adds, removes and reorders need only the fresh array; editing an existing item needs
  both. `createChat` keeps `messages` in a `$state` rune and assigns a fresh array on
  every update rather than mutating it. To rename a conversation:
  ```ts
  // Stale: the title changed, but the item object did not, so the row never updates.
  conversations.find((c) => c.id === id)!.title = 'Renamed';
  conversations = [...conversations];

  // Renders: a new array, and the one item that changed is a new object.
  conversations = conversations.map((c) => (c.id === id ? { ...c, title: 'Renamed' } : c));
  ```
- **Events are non-bubbling `kai-*` CustomEvents.** Listen on the element with the
  Svelte 5 event attributes `onkai-submit`, `onkai-message-action`,
  `onkai-conversation-select`, … and read `(e as CustomEvent).detail`. (`kai-button`
  fires the native bubbling `click`, so it uses `onclick`.)

## How it works

- `src/App.svelte` composes the web components by hand: `<kai-resizable>` for the split,
  `<kai-conversations>` (via `Sidebar.svelte`), `<kai-thread>` (via `ThreadView.svelte`),
  and `<kai-prompt-input>` (via `Composer.svelte`).
- `src/lib/chat.svelte.ts` owns the message array + streaming (`append`,
  `setMessages`, `streamAssistant`, `loading`). It's a thin Svelte port of the kit's
  React `useKaiChat`, built on the **same** framework-neutral state core
  (`@kitn.ai/ui/state`).
- `createConversations` owns the active conversation + the in-memory thread stash;
  `createVoiceInput` is a Svelte port of the kit's mic hook.
- The composer stays **uncontrolled** so the `/` (skills) and `@` (agents) trigger
  menus keep a live caret — clear-on-submit calls the element's `clear()` method and
  voice seeds a `ComposerDoc` rather than assigning a plain string `value`.
- A light/dark toggle (top-right) drives each element's `theme` prop and a `.dark`
  class on the shell, so the kit's `--color-*` tokens flip for your own chrome too.

The example consumes the kit from this monorepo via `workspace:*`, so it always
builds against the local `@kitn.ai/ui` (through the package `exports` map, exactly
like a published consumer — no aliases).

## Run it

From the repo root, build the kit once so its `dist/` exists (the example imports
the compiled `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components` + `@kitn.ai/ui/theme.tokens.css`), then start
the example:

```bash
pnpm exec nx build ui
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-svelte dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (default <http://localhost:5173>).

## Build / typecheck

```bash
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-svelte typecheck
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-svelte build
```
