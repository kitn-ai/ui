# Angular example — chat workspace, composed by hand

A small chat **workspace assembled from `@kitn.ai/ui`'s individual web components** — a
`<kai-conversations>` sidebar, a `<kai-thread>` of messages, and a
`<kai-prompt-input>` composer — wired together with plain Angular signals. Non-React
frameworks consume the **raw `kai-*` web components directly** (no wrappers), so this
is the reference for how that composition looks in Angular. It mirrors
`examples/starters/react` and `examples/starters/vue` feature-for-feature.

It runs with **no backend**: replies stream in from the kit's own mock responder,
`createMockResponder()` from `@kitn.ai/ui/state` (wired up in `src/chat-data.ts`),
so there's no API key and nothing to host. The mock yields SSE frames that
`readOpenAIStream` parses exactly as it parses a real provider's, so the preview
runs the real streaming path — and swapping `mockResponse(text)` for a real
`fetch` (Anthropic, OpenAI, your own endpoint) is the only change you make.

Nothing here can be mistaken for a real turn: the stream opens with a `: kai-mock`
SSE comment, every frame carries a `_kai_mock` field, `model` reports as
`kai-mock`, and usage is all zeros.

## The Angular web-component rules

Consuming Shadow-DOM custom elements from Angular comes down to five things:

- **Allow the tags with `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`.** Every standalone component that
  uses `kai-*` tags adds `schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]`, so Angular passes
  property/event bindings straight to the DOM instead of erroring on unknown
  elements.
- **Register before bootstrap.** `src/main.ts` does `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'`
  and then gates `bootstrapApplication` on `customElements.whenDefined(...)` for
  every tag used. The web components register **asynchronously**, and Angular sets
  array/object DOM properties the moment it stamps a tag — a write before upgrade is
  clobbered by the element's empty defaults on upgrade. The theme tokens
  (`@kitn.ai/ui/theme.tokens.css`) load as a global stylesheet via `angular.json`
  (Angular loads global CSS from the build config, not a TS import).
- **Array/object props are DOM properties.** Angular property binding (`[messages]`,
  `[conversations]`, `[groups]`, `[triggers]`, `[suggestions]`) sets the DOM property
  on a custom element. Scalars the element reads as attributes bind with
  `[attr.active-id]`; the rest (`[theme]`, `[loading]`, `[collapsed]`) bind as
  properties, and fixed strings like `size="280px"` are plain attributes.
- **Updating a list needs a new array AND a new object for each item you changed.**
  The new array reference is what tells the element something changed — assigning the
  same array back is a no-op even if you swapped an item inside it. The new item object
  is what makes the change visible, because the lists key their rows by item identity.
  Adds, removes and reorders need only the fresh array; editing an existing item needs
  both. `createChat` keeps `messages` in a signal and `.set()`s a fresh array on every
  update. To rename a conversation:
  ```ts
  // Stale: the title changed, but the item object did not, so the row never updates.
  conversations.update((list) => { list.find((c) => c.id === id)!.title = 'Renamed'; return [...list]; });

  // Renders: a new array, and the one item that changed is a new object.
  conversations.update((list) => list.map((c) => (c.id === id ? { ...c, title: 'Renamed' } : c)));
  ```
- **Boolean flags read the JS property first, then the attribute.** Bind `[voice]="true"`:
  the facade's `flag()` takes an explicit JS `false` over a present attribute, so the bound
  property is the one that can still turn a flag back off. A bare `voice` attribute is read
  as **true**, not false — presence is what counts, and only `voice="false"` reads as false.
- **Events are non-bubbling `kai-*` CustomEvents.** Bind on the element with
  `(kai-submit)`, `(kai-message-action)`, `(kai-conversation-select)`, … and read
  `($event as CustomEvent).detail`.

## How it works

- `src/app/app.ts` + its `app.html` template compose the web components by hand:
  `<kai-resizable>` for the split, `<kai-conversations>` (via
  `components/sidebar/sidebar.ts`), `<kai-thread>` (via
  `components/thread-view/thread-view.ts`), and `<kai-prompt-input>` (via
  `components/composer/composer.ts`).
- `src/app/state/chat.store.ts` owns the message array + streaming (`append`,
  `setMessages`, `streamAssistant`, `loading`). It's a thin Angular port of the kit's
  React `useKaiChat`, built on the **same** framework-neutral state core
  (`@kitn.ai/ui/state`).
- `conversations.store.ts` owns the active conversation + the in-memory thread stash;
  `state/voice-input.ts` is a framework-neutral port of the kit's mic hook.
- The composer stays **uncontrolled** so the `/` (skills) and `@` (agents) trigger
  menus keep a live caret — clear-on-submit calls the element's `clear()` method and
  voice seeds a `ComposerDoc` rather than assigning a plain string `value`.
- A light/dark toggle (top-right) drives each element's `theme` prop and a `.dark`
  class on the shell, so the kit's `--color-*` tokens flip for your own chrome too.

The example consumes the kit from this monorepo via `workspace:*`, so it always
builds against the local `@kitn.ai/ui` (through the package `exports` map, exactly
like a published consumer — no aliases).

## Build tooling

This example targets the latest Angular (v22) on the modern **`@angular/build:application`**
builder (esbuild under the hood) rather than a custom Vite setup — it's the
least-surprising, best-supported way to build an Angular SPA, and it consumes the
compiled `@kitn.ai/ui` package the same way a real Angular app would.

It's also **zoneless**: Angular 22 drops `zone.js` by default, so there's no polyfill
and `app.config.ts` provides `provideZonelessChangeDetection()`. The app is fully
signal-based (`createChat`/`createConversations` hold state in signals, streaming
assigns a fresh `messages` array per chunk) and the `(kai-*)` event bindings schedule
change detection, so streaming, theming, conversation switching, and sidebar collapse
all update without Zone.

## Run it

From the repo root, build the kit once so its `dist/` exists (the example imports the
compiled `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components` + `@kitn.ai/ui/theme.tokens.css`), then start the
example:

```bash
pnpm exec nx build ui
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-angular dev
```

Open the URL the Angular CLI prints (default <http://localhost:4200>).

The Angular 22 CLI requires **Node >= 22.22.3** (or >= 24.15). If `pnpm example:angular`
fails with a Node-version error, upgrade Node; the other examples run on any Node 22.

## Build

```bash
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-angular build
```
