# Examples

Runnable starters that consume `@kitn.ai/ui` the way a real app does. The five in
the starter set are the canonical reference; `apps/` holds the ladder's real
applications; a few older demos live below them.

## Starter set: hand-composed chat workspaces

Five parallel examples, one per framework, each building the **same** small chat
workspace by composing the kit's individual `kai-*` elements by hand: a
resizable sidebar split, a `kai-conversations` rail, a streaming `kai-thread`, a
`kai-prompt-input` composer, a light/dark toggle, and voice input. The point is
to show how the pieces fit together, not to drop in one batteries-included
`<kai-chat>` tag.

They run with no backend. Replies come from the kit's own `createMockResponder()`
(`@kitn.ai/ui/state`, wired up in each starter's `src/chat-data.ts`), so there's
no API key and nothing to host. It yields canned SSE frames that
`readOpenAIStream` parses exactly as it parses a real provider's, so the preview
runs the real streaming path rather than a lookalike. Swap `mockResponse(text)`
for a real `fetch` and you have a real app.

Nothing there can be mistaken for a real turn: the stream opens with a
`: kai-mock` SSE comment, every frame carries a `_kai_mock` field, `model`
reports as `kai-mock`, and usage is all zeros.

| Directory | Framework | Kit API used |
|---|---|---|
| `starters/react/` | React 19 | Generated React wrappers from `@kitn.ai/ui/react` (`<Conversations>`, `<Message>`, `<PromptInput>`) |
| `starters/vue/` | Vue 3 | Raw `kai-*` web components via `:prop.prop` bindings + `@kai-*` handlers |
| `starters/svelte/` | Svelte 5 (runes) | Raw `kai-*` web components via `bind:this` + `$effect` + `onkai-*` handlers |
| `starters/vanilla/` | Plain TypeScript (Vite) | Raw `kai-*` web components, composed imperatively; no framework |
| `starters/angular/` | Angular 22 (standalone, zoneless) | Raw `kai-*` web components via `[prop]` / `(kai-*)` + `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` |

All five are pnpm-workspace members that depend on the kit with
`"@kitn.ai/ui": "workspace:*"`, so they build against the local source through
the package `exports` map, exactly like a published consumer. No aliases, no
pointing at a raw bundle.

### Run

Build the kit once first, then start any example with its shortcut script:

```bash
pnpm install       # once
pnpm build:ui      # build the kit into packages/ui/dist/ (or: pnpm exec nx build ui)
pnpm example:react # start the React example on http://localhost:5173
```

`build:ui` produces `packages/ui/dist/`, a gitignored artifact the examples
import. Build it once before starting a dev server, and rebuild after you change
the kit.

Each example has a shortcut script and a fixed dev port:

| Script | URL |
|---|---|
| `pnpm example:react` | <http://localhost:5173> |
| `pnpm example:vue` | <http://localhost:5174> |
| `pnpm example:svelte` | <http://localhost:5175> |
| `pnpm example:vanilla` | <http://localhost:5176> |
| `pnpm example:angular` | <http://localhost:4200> |

Longhand still works: `pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-<dir> dev`, or run it in
place with `cd examples/starters/<dir> && pnpm dev`.

Each example's own `README.md` documents the per-framework web-component rules
(registering `kai-*` before mount, setting array/object data as DOM properties,
listening for non-bubbling `kai-*` events, keeping the composer uncontrolled).
`starters/react/` is the reference the others mirror.

## Applications

`apps/` is the iteration ladder's corpus: whole applications built with the kit,
one per rung, each one a thing you could hand someone rather than a tour of the
parts. They are pnpm-workspace members on `"@kitn.ai/ui": "workspace:*"` like the
starters, and `verify:starters` derives its roster from both directories, so CI
builds and typechecks every app the day it lands.

| Directory | Rung | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/support-widget/` | 1 | A docked support chat on a product page: `<kai-dock>` launcher + panel, streaming replies, no history. Vanilla TS + Vite. Mock frames with no key, OpenRouter with one, and the same client path either way. |
| `apps/voice-assistant/` | 2 | A hands-free voice assistant: browser-native speech in and out, `kai-thread` transcript, `kai-audio-visualizer` on real mic amplitude, push-to-talk. Vanilla TS + Vite. Same mock/OpenRouter seam as rung 1; the app code was built front-door by a clean-room agent from the kai MCP alone (provenance in its README). |
| `apps/workspace/` | 3 | A multi-conversation chat workspace: `kai-conversations` rail beside `kai-chat`, thread switching, delete with undo, search, and localStorage persistence that survives a reload mid-conversation. React + Vite on the `@kitn.ai/ui/react` wrappers. Same mock/OpenRouter seam; front-door-built by a clean-room agent (provenance in its README). |
| `apps/builder/` | 4 | An AI page builder: chat left, live preview right. Each reply carries a whole self-contained HTML page as a `kai_artifact` tool call, which becomes a `kai-artifact` preview, a compact custom card in the thread, and a `kai-checkpoint` version you can restore. Device widths, maximize, Preview/Code. React + Vite. Same mock/OpenRouter seam; front-door-built by a clean-room agent (provenance in its README). |
| `apps/ops-console/` | 5 | An internal ops console: the assistant *proposes* consequential actions as interactive cards — approvals, a strategy picker, a parameters form, a live checklist — and nothing happens until the operator clicks. Beside the thread, a live run board served from a **second origin** and framed through `<kai-remote>`, whose rollback button arrives in the chat as a proposal. React + Vite, **two** dev servers. Same mock/OpenRouter seam; front-door-built by a clean-room agent (provenance in its README). |
| `apps/composed-thread/` | 6 | A chat client whose conversation UI is composed **by hand from standalone elements** — no `<kai-chat>` anywhere: `kai-thread`, `kai-composer`, `kai-attachments`, `kai-conversation-item`, `kai-toast-region`, `kai-feedback-bar`, wired by a host module. Streaming via `createAssistantStream` + `readOpenAIStream` over the in-browser mock responder (a scripted `search_docs` tool call included), file attach round-trip onto the sent message. Vanilla TS + Vite, no server at all; front-door-built by a clean-room agent (provenance in its README). |

```bash
pnpm build:ui                                        # once
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-support-widget dev     # http://localhost:5178
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-voice-assistant dev    # http://localhost:5179
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-workspace dev          # http://localhost:5180
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-builder dev            # http://localhost:5181
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-ops-console dev        # http://localhost:5182 + board on 5183
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-app-composed-thread dev    # http://localhost:5184
```

Each app's own `README.md` has the rest — how the turn works, what it needs to
run for real, and what it deliberately leaves out.

## Other examples

These predate the starter-set refresh and consume the kit their own way.

### Static ES-module demos

- **`demos/composable/`**: the full roster of individual elements plus the
  batteries-included `<kai-chat>`, as a plain HTML page.

It is an ES-module web-component page: it must be **served over HTTP** (opening it
as a `file://` page fails, because browsers block ES-module loading from a `null`
origin, so nothing registers and you get empty boxes). Serve the **repo root**:

```bash
pnpm build:ui                            # once, to produce packages/ui/dist/
pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui run examples   # serves the repo root on http://localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/examples/demos/composable/index.html`.

It loads the local build at `packages/ui/dist/kai.es.js`, so build the kit first
and rebuild after you change it. Any static server rooted at the repo works as
well (`npx serve .`); adjust the port to whatever it prints.

`demos/widget/` is gone. It was the same docked-widget shape as
`apps/support-widget/`, but loaded off unpkg with hand-rolled canned replies and
outside every CI guard, so the real app replaces it. What went with it and has no
home yet: the no-build CDN path, `configureCodeHighlighting()` loading a Shiki
grammar on demand, attachments folded onto the user turn, and canned reasoning +
tool parts.

### A plain website

- **`demos/vesper/`**: the AW26 editorial landing page for "Vesper", extracted out
  of the **Labs/Apps → v0** story (`packages/ui/src/elements/v0.stories.tsx`),
  which builds it inline as the page it frames in `<kai-artifact>`. Real files
  now: one stylesheet, one script, self-hosted fonts, six photographs. It uses
  **none of the kit** and needs no build — serve the directory and it runs. Its
  `tools/extract-from-story.mjs` re-derives it from the story, which stays the
  source. See its own `README.md`.

### Framework and meta-framework apps

- **`starters/solid/`**: SolidJS Vite app that uses the raw SolidJS component API
  from `@kitn.ai/ui/solid`, the complete SolidJS surface, which lives off the root
  entry so the React/Vue/Svelte/vanilla majority do not ship a catalog they cannot
  render. A pnpm-workspace member on `"@kitn.ai/ui": "workspace:*"`, like the other
  SPA starters.
- **`starters/nextjs/`**: Next.js 15 App Router, SSR + RSC `'use client'`, on the
  generated React wrappers (`@kitn.ai/ui/react`).
- **`starters/tanstack-start/`**: TanStack Start, SSR + hydration, also on the
  generated React wrappers.

`starters/nextjs/` and `starters/tanstack-start/` install the kit from the local
repo via `file:../../..` (not aliased), the way a real consumer would. Build the
kit at the repo root first, then `cd` in, `npm install`, and `npm run build`.

### Support fixtures

`internal/remote-host/`, `internal/remote-provider/`, `internal/shared/`, and
`internal/artifact-fixtures/` are not standalone demos. They hold shared sample
data and assets, the remote generative-UI host/provider harness, and artifact
render fixtures used by the other examples.
