# Examples

Runnable starters that consume `@kitn.ai/ui` the way a real app does. The five in
the starter set are the canonical reference; a few older demos live below them.

## Starter set: hand-composed chat workspaces

Five parallel examples, one per framework, each building the **same** small chat
workspace by composing the kit's individual `kai-*` elements by hand: a
resizable sidebar split, a `kai-conversations` rail, a streaming `kai-thread`, a
`kai-prompt-input` composer, a light/dark toggle, and voice input. The point is
to show how the pieces fit together, not to drop in one batteries-included
`<kai-chat>` tag.

They run with no backend. Replies stream from a local fake responder
(`src/chat-data.ts`), so there's no API key and nothing to host. Swap
`streamFakeReply` for a real model call and you have a real app.

| Directory | Framework | Kit API used |
|---|---|---|
| `react/` | React 19 | Generated React wrappers from `@kitn.ai/ui/react` (`<Conversations>`, `<Message>`, `<PromptInput>`) |
| `vue/` | Vue 3 | Raw `kai-*` web components via `:prop.prop` bindings + `@kai-*` handlers |
| `svelte/` | Svelte 5 (runes) | Raw `kai-*` web components via `bind:this` + `$effect` + `onkai-*` handlers |
| `vanilla/` | Plain TypeScript (Vite) | Raw `kai-*` web components, composed imperatively; no framework |
| `angular/` | Angular 18 (standalone) | Raw `kai-*` web components via `[prop]` / `(kai-*)` + `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` |

All five are pnpm-workspace members that depend on the kit with
`"@kitn.ai/ui": "workspace:*"`, so they build against the local source through
the package `exports` map, exactly like a published consumer. No aliases, no
pointing at a raw bundle.

### Run

Build the kit once first, then start any example with its shortcut script:

```bash
pnpm install       # once
pnpm build:ui      # build the kit into packages/ui/dist/ (or: pnpm exec nx build ui)
pnpm example:react # start the React example on http://localhost:5173
```

`build:ui` produces `packages/ui/dist/`, a gitignored artifact the examples
import. Build it once before starting a dev server, and rebuild after you change
the kit.

Each example has a shortcut script and a fixed dev port:

| Script | URL |
|---|---|
| `pnpm example:react` | <http://localhost:5173> |
| `pnpm example:vue` | <http://localhost:5174> |
| `pnpm example:svelte` | <http://localhost:5175> |
| `pnpm example:vanilla` | <http://localhost:5176> |
| `pnpm example:angular` | <http://localhost:4200> |

Longhand still works: `pnpm --filter @kitn.ai/ui-example-<dir> dev`, or run it in
place with `cd examples/<dir> && pnpm dev`.

Each example's own `README.md` documents the per-framework web-component rules
(registering `kai-*` before mount, setting array/object data as DOM properties,
listening for non-bubbling `kai-*` events, keeping the composer uncontrolled).
`react/` is the reference the others mirror.

## Other examples

These predate the starter-set refresh and consume the kit their own way.

### Static ES-module demos

- **`composable/`**: the full roster of individual elements plus the
  batteries-included `<kai-chat>`, as a plain HTML page.
- **`widget/`**: a floating chat widget.

Both are ES-module web-component pages: they must be **served over HTTP** (opening
them as a `file://` page fails, because browsers block ES-module loading from a
`null` origin, so nothing registers and you get empty boxes). Serve the **repo
root** with any static server:

```bash
npx serve .        # serve the repo root over HTTP (or: python3 -m http.server 8000)
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/examples/composable/index.html` or
`.../examples/widget/index.html` (adjust the port to whatever your server prints).

Caveat: these older demos load a repo-root `dist/kai.es.js` bundle. The current
kit build writes to `packages/ui/dist/`, not the repo root, so you may need to
produce that repo-root bundle manually before they render.

### Framework and meta-framework apps

- **`solid/`**: SolidJS Vite app that uses the raw SolidJS component API (the
  `.` entry). Not a workspace member: `cd examples/solid && npm install && npm run dev`.
- **`nextjs/`**: Next.js 15 App Router, SSR + RSC `'use client'`, on the
  generated React wrappers (`@kitn.ai/ui/react`).
- **`tanstack-start/`**: TanStack Start, SSR + hydration, also on the generated
  React wrappers.

`nextjs/` and `tanstack-start/` install the kit from the local repo via
`file:../..` (not aliased), the way a real consumer would. Build the kit at the
repo root first, then `cd` in, `npm install`, and `npm run build`.

### Support fixtures

`remote-host/`, `remote-provider/`, `shared/`, and `artifact-fixtures/` are not
standalone demos. They hold shared sample data and assets, the remote
generative-UI host/provider harness, and artifact render fixtures used by the
other examples.
