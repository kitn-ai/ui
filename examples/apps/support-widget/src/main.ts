/**
 * Rung 1 of the iteration ladder: a docked support widget on somebody else's
 * product page. Launcher, panel, one conversation, no history.
 *
 * The launcher/panel mechanics — open/close, Escape, `aria-expanded`, focus
 * return, the corner placement — belong to `<kai-dock>` in index.html now, not
 * to this file. What is left here is only the product: wiring the chat turn.
 *
 * Two contract details this file owns, both of which a framework wrapper would
 * otherwise hide:
 *
 *  1. THE UPGRADE RACE. `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components` registers asynchronously, and an
 *     array/object PROPERTY set on a tag that has not upgraded yet is lost. So
 *     nothing touches `<kai-chat>` until `customElements.whenDefined` resolves.
 *  2. NON-BUBBLING EVENTS. `kai-submit` is a plain CustomEvent with
 *     `bubbles: false`, so the listener goes on the element itself — a delegated
 *     listener on document would never fire. The text is `event.detail.value`.
