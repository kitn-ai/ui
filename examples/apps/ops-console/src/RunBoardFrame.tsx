/**
 * The cross-origin run board, framed.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `<Remote>` FROM `@kitn.ai/ui/react`.
 *
 * The generated React wrappers render the bare tag with only `ref`/`className`/
 * `style`/`id`, then assign every real prop from a `useLayoutEffect` — which
 * runs AFTER the element is in the document, so after `connectedCallback`. For
 * almost every `kai-*` element that is harmless: a late assignment is just
 * another reactive update and Solid re-renders.
 *
 * `<kai-remote>` is the exception. It reads `providerOrigin`, `src` and
 * `envelope` ONCE, in its mount, and if any is missing it renders a permanent
 * error and never retries. Through the React wrapper it therefore always mounts
 * having seen nothing, and paints:
 *
 *     [kai-remote] Invalid provider-origin "". Must be an absolute https: origin…
 *
 * while `el.providerOrigin` reads back perfectly from the console a tick later,
 * which is what makes this so hard to see. It is the `upgrade-race` invariant
 * with the halves swapped — the element is defined in time, the PROPS are late.
 *
 * So the element is created, configured and only THEN inserted. Same element,
 * same contract; the two lines that matter are the order of the last two.
 *
 * The static `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components/remote'` in main.tsx is the other
 * half: `<kai-remote>` is opt-in and register-all does not include it, and
 * `document.createElement` only upgrades a tag that is already defined.
