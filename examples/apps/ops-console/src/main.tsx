/**
 * `<kai-remote>` is OPT-IN and register-all above does NOT include it. The React
 * `Remote` wrapper does lazily import this same module — but lazily is too late,
 * and the failure is silent: React creates an un-upgraded element, sets `src` /
 * `provider-origin` / `envelope` on it as own properties, and when the definition
 * finally lands the facade's own declared props shadow them. The element then
 * mounts having seen an EMPTY provider origin and renders "Invalid
 * provider-origin """ instead of the board — while `el.providerOrigin` still
 * reads back correctly from the console, which is what makes it so confusing.
 * That is the `upgrade-race` invariant. A STATIC import here is the fix: the tag
 * is defined before React renders anything, so props are set on a live element.
