// Shadow-piercing assertion helpers for the scenario modules.
//
// THE RULE these exist to enforce: an assertion must look at what a user can
// SEE. `<kai-thread>` renders into an OPEN shadow root, and Playwright's css /
// text engines pierce open shadow roots, so `page.getByText(...)` reaches the
// tool panel's "Completed" chip and a card's buttons directly. Reading
// `window.__kaiHarness.messages` would prove the wire adapter ran and would say
// nothing about whether anything rendered — a previous version of this very app
// showed a "Completed" badge seeded from fixture data while the live loop had
// never run once.
//
// "Expanded" is likewise defined as CONTENT THE USER CAN SEE, not an attribute:
// a closed <kai-tool> keeps its panel in the DOM at `grid-rows-[0fr]` and a
// closed <kai-reasoning> keeps its body at `max-height: 0px`, so both collapse
// to a zero-height box that Playwright correctly reports as not visible. That is
// the check that would have caught the remount bug; `data-state` would not,
// because the freshly remounted panel reported `closed` perfectly happily.
//
// No `@playwright/test` VALUE is imported: everything works through methods on
// the `Page`/`Locator` objects the runner passes in, which keeps these modules
// importable from the browser bundle.

// emits its first text delta the last bubble on screen is the user's own ECHOED
// PROMPT — so for the opening of every single turn `answer()` silently meant
// "the user". That is not a hypothetical: S17 clicked Stop at ~50ms, compared
// the 89-character prompt to itself, reported `grew=0`, and passed vacuously for
// its entire existence. `seesProse` had the identical defect and S01–S05 were
// green only because they happen to assert after the stream finished — green by
// WHEN THEY RUN, not by construction. Measured on this fixture set: pointed at
// the pre-delta window, `seesProse(page, 60)` hands S04 the user's own
// 153-character prompt, which satisfies its length bound AND all three of its
// `prose.includes(city)` checks, because the prompt names the three cities.
//
// So the assistant's bubble is now selected by SPEAKER. The kit does not put the
// speaker in the rendered DOM — `<Message role>` emits `data-role` /
// `role="article"` / `aria-label`, but neither `Thread` nor `ChatApp` passes
// it, so every row in a real `<kai-thread>` is an unlabelled generic div (see
// HARNESS.md, "The thread renders no role"). Until it does, the speaker has to
// be read off the two independent things the kit DOES render differently:
//
//   row alignment   user rows carry `items-end`, assistant rows `items-start`
//   bubble skin     user bubbles carry `bg-muted rounded-2xl`, assistant ones
//                   are markdown-rendered and carry `chat-markdown`
//
// Neither is a contract, so neither is trusted alone. Selection is by alignment;
// `assertBubbleRolesAreLegible` then requires the skin signal to AGREE with it
// and the two to account for every bubble on the page. Drop `items-start` from
// assistant rows and the locator matches nothing, so a scenario goes red on a
// timeout it can explain. Add `items-start` to USER rows — the regression that
// would quietly restore the original defect — and the two signals disagree and
// every read fails naming the drift. What must never happen again is the middle
// case: a locator that still resolves, to the wrong speaker, and stays green.
