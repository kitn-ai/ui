# `@kitn.ai/ui` consumer integration issues — punch-list

**Source:** a field test building a real consumer app (fresh Vite + React + TS) against the published
`@kitn.ai/ui@0.15.1` and the `aiui` MCP server (2026-06-19). Full report: `aaaaa/report.md`.

**Scope of this doc:** the **package-level** ("Bucket B") findings — they live in the published library's
packaging/exports/peers, *not* in the agent-tooling MCP. The MCP-tool findings ("Bucket A": scaffold
side-panel/suggestions/elements-import + a `mock` integration, and new `debug` rules) were fixed on
`feat/ai-ui-agent-tooling`. The items below are **not fixed** — they need their own decisions because they
touch the whole library's build and are not pre-1.0-trivial.

The two P0s both produce the same first impression: *"I followed the docs and nothing renders / my build
breaks."* They're the highest-leverage fixes for first-time React consumers.

## P0 — Issue 1: `/react` wrappers don't register the web components

**Symptom.** Following the documented React setup renders an empty `<kai-chat>` — `customElements.get('kai-chat') === undefined`.

**Root cause.** `frameworks/react/index.tsx` only imports `./runtime`; nothing in the `/react` import graph
calls `customElements.define`. Registration lives only in the side-effect bundle `@kitn.ai/ui/web-components`
(`dist/kai.es.js`). A consumer importing only `/react` gets wrappers that render undefined elements.

**Why it bites everyone.** The package's own `llms.txt` React example omits `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'`,
so the primary onboarding path produces non-rendering code.

**Recommended fix (pick one).**
- *Preferred:* make `@kitn.ai/ui/react` self-registering — add the web-components registration as a side effect at
  the top of `frameworks/react/index.tsx` (and set `"sideEffects"` so bundlers keep it), so importing any
  wrapper guarantees the element is defined.
- *At minimum:* fix `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` (and any quickstart) to always show `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'` first.

**Affected:** `frameworks/react/index.tsx`, `frameworks/react/runtime.tsx`, `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` generator (`scripts/gen-llms.mjs`).

**Already mitigated in agent-tooling:** the MCP `scaffold` now always emits `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'` first, and `debug` has a rule for "renders nothing / not registered." The package + generated docs still need the fix.

## P0 — Issue 2: package ships raw `.tsx` source → consumers' `tsc` compiles the SolidJS internals and breaks

**Status: the preferred fix shipped.** `exports` now points `.`, `./react` and `./web-components` at compiled `.js` +
`.d.ts`, so no component source reaches a consumer. What follows is the field-test record, unedited: the paths
in the **Symptom** and **Root cause** quotes are from that run and predate the `src/ui` → `src/components`
merge, which is why they name `src/ui/*.tsx` — `hover-card.tsx` and `overlay.tsx` now live in
`src/components/`.

**Symptom.** `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) fails with ~25 errors, **all inside
`node_modules/@kitn.ai/ui/src/ui/*.tsx`** (TS2786/TS2322 for `Show`/`Portal`/`Dynamic`, `onFocusIn`, etc.),
none in app code. `vite`/`vite build` alone succeed (esbuild strips types); only `tsc` breaks. This blocks
any strict-TS React consumer's typecheck/CI.

**Root cause.** The `exports` map points `.` → `src/index.ts` and `./react` → a `.tsx`, and the `./web-components`
**type** entry does a **value** re-export from source:
```
src/web-components/web-component-types.d.ts:8
  export { configureCodeHighlighting, isCodeHighlightingEnabled } from '../primitives/highlighter';  // VALUE re-export
```
A value re-export forces `tsc` to resolve and compile `../primitives/highlighter` and, transitively, the
SolidJS components (`src/ui/hover-card.tsx`, `src/ui/overlay.tsx`, …), which don't typecheck under the
consumer's `jsx: "react-jsx"`. `skipLibCheck` doesn't help (these are `.tsx` source, not `.d.ts`).

**Consumer workaround (what unblocked the field test).** A typecheck-only `paths` redirect (Vite ignores it,
so runtime is unaffected):
```jsonc
// tsconfig.app.json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": { "@kitn.ai/ui/web-components": ["./src/stubs/kitn-web-components.d.ts"] }   // stub: export {}
```

**Recommended fix (upstream).**
- *Preferred:* ship **compiled `.js` + generated `.d.ts`** for the public entry points (`.`, `./react`,
  `./web-components`) instead of raw source; point `exports[...].types` at real `.d.ts` and `.default` at compiled
  `.js`. Then `skipLibCheck` covers consumers and no source is compiled. (This is a build-pipeline change.)
- *Cheaper interim:* make `src/web-components/web-component-types.d.ts` **type-only** — move the value re-export of
  `configureCodeHighlighting`/`isCodeHighlightingEnabled` to the runtime `./web-components` JS, so the `.d.ts`
  pulls no implementation.

**Affected:** `package.json` `exports`, `src/web-components/web-component-types.d.ts`, the build pipeline (emit `.d.ts`+`.js`), and (only if you keep shipping source) `src/components/hover-card.tsx` / `src/components/overlay.tsx`.

**Already partly surfaced in agent-tooling:** `debug` has a rule that recognizes "tsc errors inside node_modules/@kitn.ai/ui/src" and hands back the `paths`-stub workaround, noting it's a tracked packaging gap.

## P2 — Issue 7: `peerDependencies` are inverted for React consumers

```
peerDependencies:     { "react": ">=18", "solid-js": "^1.9.0" }
peerDependenciesMeta: { "react": { "optional": true } }   // solid-js NOT optional
```
`solid-js` (the authoring runtime, bundled into `dist`) is a **required** peer while `react` (what `/react`
consumers actually use) is **optional** — backwards. npm v7+ auto-installs `solid-js` so no hard error
surfaced, but it's misleading and will warn under stricter installers / pnpm.

**Recommended fix.** Move `solid-js` to a regular `dependency` (it's bundled), or mark it optional in
`peerDependenciesMeta`. Keep `react` optional; document that `/react` needs React.

**Affected:** `package.json` `peerDependencies` / `peerDependenciesMeta`.

## P3 — Issue 8: default bundle pulls large Shiki language chunks

A basic `<Chat>` `vite build` emits ~600 kB of Shiki language chunks (bash/css/html/js/ts/tsx/vue/svelte;
main chunk 615 kB / 174 kB gzip → "chunks > 500 kB" warning). Syntax highlighting registers many languages
by default, even for a chat that may never render code.

**Recommended fix.** Lazy-load language grammars on first code block, and document the existing escape
hatches prominently: `codeHighlight={false}` on `<kai-chat>` and `configureCodeHighlighting(...)`.

**Affected:** `src/primitives/highlighter.ts`, docs.

---

## P3 — Issue 9: `theme.css` rewrites a Tailwind v4 consumer's theme (tokens, dark variant, scales, globals)

**Symptom.** A consumer who imports the optional `@kitn.ai/ui/theme.css` into a Tailwind v4 build finds their
own `bg-primary` / `bg-card` / etc. utilities change color — our generic `--color-*` token names merged into
their `@theme` and the last `@import` wins. The field test found three more effects the docs never named:
their `dark:` utilities stop matching (the file's `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` silently switches the
consumer from `prefers-color-scheme` to class-based dark), their `rounded-lg` moves from `0.5rem` to `0.6rem`
(`--radius-sm/md/lg/xl` re-point Tailwind's stock radius scale at the kit's `--radius`), and `text-sm` in their
own markup follows any `--kai-text-*` override (`--text-xs/sm/base/lg` are aliased onto the kit's type scale;
the theming guide called that a feature without saying it edits the consumer's scale).

**Root cause.** `theme.css` defines shadcn-style **unprefixed** `--color-*` tokens, Tailwind's own
`--radius-*` / `--text-*` names, a `@custom-variant dark`, and, before this fix, fourteen generic global
`@keyframes` — `blink` / `wave` / `shimmer` / `pulse-dot` / … — and a `.scrollbar-thin` utility. Tailwind v4
treats in-scope `--color-*` custom properties as `@theme` entries, so importing our sheet overrides any
same-named consumer token. `dist/theme.tokens.css` hoisted all fourteen keyframes and `.scrollbar-thin` into
the `<link>` consumer's global scope too.

**Why component usage is safe.** Consumers who only *use* the `kai-*` web components are unaffected — everything
is shadow-isolated, inherited props are pinned at `:host`, and a consumer's global CSS / Tailwind preflight /
`* {}` / same-named `--color-*` cannot reach inside a component's Shadow DOM. The collision is **opt-in**: it
only happens when you import `theme.css` into your own build. The default path (no import; theme via the
namespaced `--kai-color-*`) avoids all of it.

**Fix (shipped).**
- *Globals prefixed:* every `@keyframes` in `theme.css` is now `kai-<name>` (`kai-blink`, `kai-shimmer`,
  `kai-spinner-fade`, …) and `.scrollbar-thin` is `.kai-scrollbar-thin`. The `collapsible-down` / `-up` pair
  was deleted rather than prefixed: it shadowed tw-animate-css's keyframes of the same name, and both were dead
  (`CollapsibleContent` in `src/components/collapsible.tsx` puts the caller's class on an inner div that carries no
  `data-state`, so the `data-[state=*]:animate-*` classes on `tool.tsx` / `chain-of-thought.tsx` never matched;
  the visible collapse is the grid-template-rows transition). Those classes are gone too. No alias for the old
  names: no consumer-facing doc ever named one.
  `.chat-markdown` stays, unprefixed, as the one public class (renaming it is a breaking change) and is now
  documented as a global the kit owns. `tests/web-components/theme-globals.test.ts` pins the prefix rule and that
  every `animate-[…]` / `animate-*` reference in `src/` resolves to a declared keyframe — the one thing the
  Tailwind compiler does not check.
- *Documented* (`guides/theming.mdx` "What theme.css changes in a Tailwind build", pointer from
  `installation.mdx`): the dark-variant switch, the `--color-*` merge, the radius and text re-points, the
  `@utility` additions, the global names, and which of those `theme.tokens.css` also carries (it skips the
  variant and the utilities but still sets the same `--radius-*` / `--text-*` variables on `:root`, which
  Tailwind utilities read at runtime). `theme.tokens.css` is the recommended default for Tailwind consumers
  who do not want the kit's scale; `theme.css` is framed as opting into it. Also documented: `rem` resolves
  against the host `<html>` font-size inside shadow roots, inherited text properties the web components do not pin
  (`text-align`, `text-transform`, `font-weight`, `white-space`) leak in, and class-based-dark apps must set
  `theme="dark"` on the web components.
- The `--color-*` token names stay generic by design (the shadcn-compat surface) and alias through
  `--kai-color-*` for the no-collision path. The dark variant, radius and text re-points stay too; they are the
  opt-in the file now says it is.

**Affected:** `theme.css`, `dist/theme.tokens.css` (derived), `src/components/loader.tsx` / `text-shimmer.tsx` / `tool.tsx` / `chain-of-thought.tsx` / `artifact.tsx`, `src/components/scroll-area.tsx`, `src/web-components/file-tree/file-tree.tsx`, `apps/docs/src/content/docs/guides/theming.mdx`, `apps/docs/src/content/docs/guides/installation.mdx`, `docs/coupling-map.md` (§4 keyframes ↔ references, §9 theme.css ↔ the consumer's `@theme`).

## Documentation gaps (from the same field test)

1. **React quickstart is wrong** — `llms.txt` "React" omits `import '@kitn.ai/ui/web-components'`, the single most
   important line for React (Issue 1).
2. **No "consuming from a strict TS project" note** — nothing warns the package ships source and `tsc` will
   compile it, nor documents the `paths` workaround (Issue 2).
3. **No Vite-SPA backend guidance** — a Vite/React user handed a Next.js route with no note that Vite has no
   API routes / how to wire a dev middleware or proxy. (The MCP scaffold now says this + offers `mock`.)
4. **`<kai-chat>` sizing/layout** — it needs a sized container; `flex: 1; min-height: 0` in a `height: 100dvh`
   flex column makes it fill. Worth a "put it in a sized container; here's a full-height panel" snippet.
5. **`theme` defaults to `auto`** — in a light host panel on a dark-mode OS the chat renders dark inside a
   white panel. Note: align `theme` with surrounding chrome (`theme="light"`).
6. **`suggestions` is only in `component_reference`** — not in any quickstart, so consumers don't learn it
   exists. (The MCP scaffold now emits it.)
7. **Registration vs tree-shaking** — no guidance on `sideEffects` / importing one web component vs all 44.

## What worked well (from the report — keep)

- MCP `component_reference` rated "excellent / what unblocked me" — accurate props/events + the
  property-vs-attribute and `kai-submit → e.detail.value` contract.
- The React wrapper design (typed props, `on<Event>` handlers, arrays/objects via DOM properties) is good
  **once the web components are registered**.
- `suggestions` + `suggestionMode="submit"` + auto-hide-once-thread-starts is exactly right for starters.
- Streaming markdown rendering looked great out of the box. `npm install` was clean (0 vulnerabilities).
